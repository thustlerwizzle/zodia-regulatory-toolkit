# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-28T00:25:59.454935

## Executive Summary
The current AML/CFT policy demonstrates reactive updates to specific regulatory changes but lacks a cohesive, integrated framework. Critical gaps exist in EU MiCA authorization requirements and proper jurisdictional application of New Zealand FMA guidance. The policy shows evidence of fragmented updates with duplication (particularly IRS requirements) and poor version control. While core AML/CFT elements for Dubai, UK, and Jersey are addressed, significant gaps remain for other jurisdictions in the original query scope (South Africa, broader UAE). The integration of digital asset-specific requirements from CFTC and tax compliance from IRS is incomplete and not properly structured within the overall compliance framework. Priority should be given to establishing proper EU MiCA compliance, correcting jurisdictional misapplications, and creating an integrated multi-regulatory framework.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** EU MiCA Regulation - Authorization requirements for Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs) operating in the European Union

**Current Status:** Policy mentions MiCA stablecoin guidance updates but lacks explicit CASP authorization requirements for EU operations

**Gap:** Policy does not explicitly incorporate Article 1 scope of MiCA requiring authorization for all CASPs operating in EU. Current updates focus only on stablecoin provisions.

**Impact:** Potential inability to legally operate in EU markets, regulatory enforcement actions, fines, and business disruption

**Recommendation:** Add explicit MiCA CASP authorization requirements to Section 2 (Regulatory Framework) and create EU-specific implementation procedures in Section 4

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-002
**Requirement:** New Zealand FMA Crypto Guidance - Economic substance classification methodology for financial products

**Recommendation:** Correct jurisdictional mapping, create NZ-specific classification matrix, implement proper jurisdictional overlay procedures

### Gap 2: GAP-003
**Requirement:** CFTC Press Releases - Digital asset-specific AML requirements including enhanced due diligence for high-risk customers

**Recommendation:** Integrate CFTC digital asset requirements into Sections 4-5 (Key Requirements & Procedures), create unified risk assessment methodology

### Gap 3: GAP-004
**Requirement:** IRS Crypto Tax Guidance - Comprehensive tax compliance framework for U.S. persons

**Recommendation:** Consolidate IRS requirements into dedicated tax compliance appendix, separate from AML/CFT core policy, ensure consistent implementation steps
