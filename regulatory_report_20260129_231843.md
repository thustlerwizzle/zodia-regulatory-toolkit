# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-29T23:12:26.519232

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits a complete absence of regulatory compliance frameworks across all critical areas required for digital asset operations. Current policies are non-existent, creating extreme regulatory risk exposure. Immediate action is required to establish foundational compliance programs, particularly for AML/CTF, sanctions screening, and licensing requirements. The company is currently operating in a high-risk non-compliant state that could result in severe regulatory consequences, including business closure, substantial fines, and potential criminal liability. A phased implementation approach is recommended, beginning with critical priority gaps while developing comprehensive policies for all regulatory requirements.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Travel Rule compliance (FATF Recommendation 16) requiring VASPs to collect and share originator/beneficiary information for crypto transactions above threshold amounts

**Current Status:** No policy exists for Travel Rule compliance

**Gap:** Complete absence of procedures for collecting, verifying, or transmitting required customer information for cryptocurrency transactions

**Impact:** Regulatory enforcement actions, fines, license revocation, inability to operate in regulated jurisdictions, potential criminal liability for AML violations

**Recommendation:** Develop and implement a comprehensive Travel Rule compliance program including customer due diligence procedures, information sharing protocols with other VASPs, and transaction monitoring for threshold-based reporting

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) programs as mandated by global regulators (FinCEN, FCA, MAS, etc.)

**Current Status:** No AML/CTF policy framework exists

**Gap:** Missing risk assessment, customer identification program (CIP), suspicious activity monitoring, reporting mechanisms, and designated compliance officer

**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, business closure, reputational damage, potential facilitation of illicit financial activities

**Recommendation:** Establish a comprehensive AML/CTF program including: 1) Risk-based assessment, 2) Customer Identification Program (CIP), 3) Transaction monitoring system, 4) Suspicious Activity Reporting procedures, 5) Designation of AML Compliance Officer

### Gap 3: GAP-007
**Requirement:** Licensing and registration requirements for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs)

**Current Status:** No licensing strategy or compliance monitoring

**Gap:** Absence of jurisdictional analysis, licensing requirements assessment, and ongoing compliance monitoring for required registrations

**Impact:** Operating without required licenses, immediate regulatory shutdown, criminal penalties, inability to access banking relationships

**Recommendation:** Conduct jurisdictional analysis to determine licensing requirements, develop licensing strategy, establish ongoing compliance monitoring for license maintenance

### Gap 4: GAP-008
**Requirement:** Sanctions compliance and screening obligations (OFAC, EU sanctions, etc.)

**Current Status:** No sanctions screening program

**Gap:** Missing procedures to screen customers, transactions, and counterparties against global sanctions lists

**Impact:** Severe penalties including substantial fines, criminal charges, loss of correspondent banking relationships, reputational damage

**Recommendation:** Implement automated sanctions screening system, establish procedures for ongoing screening, develop blocked property reporting procedures, designate sanctions compliance officer

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Market conduct and consumer protection regulations (disclosures, fair trading, conflict management)

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive consumer protection framework including: clear risk disclosures, terms of service, complaint resolution procedures, conflict of interest policies, and fair trading guidelines

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Data privacy and protection compliance (GDPR, CCPA, and other jurisdictional requirements)

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive data privacy program including: privacy notice, consent management, data subject request procedures, data breach response plan, and data protection impact assessments

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Financial recordkeeping and audit trail requirements (transaction records, customer information, compliance documentation)

**Recommendation:** Establish comprehensive recordkeeping policy specifying retention periods, storage requirements, accessibility protocols, and audit trail maintenance for all regulated activities

### Gap 4: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Cybersecurity and operational resilience requirements (including incident response and business continuity)

**Recommendation:** Develop and implement cybersecurity framework including: security controls, incident response plan, business continuity plan, third-party risk management, and regular security assessments
