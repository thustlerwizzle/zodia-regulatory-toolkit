## Regulatory Requirements Summary

**Summary of Cryptocurrency, Digital Asset & Blockchain Regulatory Landscape**

**1. Key Global Regulatory Requirements**
- **Anti-Money Laundering (AML) & Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF):** Mandatory registration/licensing for VASPs (Virtual Asset Service Providers) with financial intelligence units. Adherence to the FATF Travel Rule (Rule 15/16) requiring originator/beneficiary information for transfers.
- **Securities Regulation:** Application of existing securities laws (e.g., Howey Test in the U.S., EU's MiCA criteria) to determine if a digital asset is a security, triggering registration, disclosure, and trading venue requirements.
- **Consumer Protection:** Requirements for clear disclosures, fair marketing, custody safeguards, and complaint redress mechanisms. Emphasis on risk warnings for retail investors.
- **Tax Compliance:** Obligations for reporting capital gains, income from staking/mining, and transactional data to tax authorities. Evolving guidance on valuation and reporting frameworks.
- **Market Integrity:** Rules against market manipulation, insider trading, and fraud in trading venues. Requirements for transparent order books and trade reporting.

**2. Core Compliance Obligations for Entities**
- **Licensing & Registration:** Obtain necessary licenses (e.g., NY BitLicense, Singapore’s PSA) before operating.
- **KYC/CDD:** Implement robust Know Your Customer and Customer Due Diligence procedures, including identity verification and ongoing monitoring.
- **Transaction Monitoring & Reporting:** Establish systems to detect and report suspicious activity (SARs/STRs). Comply with Travel Rule data sharing.
- **Financial & Operational Resilience:** Maintain capital/asset reserves, cybersecurity protocols, and custody solutions (often requiring segregation of client assets).
- **Recordkeeping:** Comprehensive, auditable records of all transactions, customer data, and compliance decisions.
- **Governance & Training:** Appoint a Compliance Officer, establish a clear governance framework, and conduct regular staff training on regulatory obligations.

**3. Recent Major Regulatory Changes**
- **EU Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA):** Comprehensive, harmonized framework (fully applicable end-2024) for crypto-asset issuance, trading, and service provision across the EU, with strict requirements for stablecoins.
- **UK’s Phased Implementation:** Bringing cryptoasset promotions under financial promotion rules (June 2023) and planning a full regulatory regime for fiat-backed stablecoins and broader activities.
- **U.S. Regulatory Expansion:** Increased enforcement by SEC (treating many tokens as securities), CFTC (overseeing crypto commodities and derivatives), and FinCEN (emphasizing Travel Rule compliance). Pending legislative clarity.
- **Hong Kong’s Licensing Regime:** Implemented mandatory licensing for VASPs (June 2023), allowing retail trading on licensed platforms with stringent safeguards.
- **FATF Revisions:** Ongoing updates to guidance, increasing focus on DeFi, NFTs, and peer-to-peer transactions.

**4. Jurisdiction-Specific Highlights**
- **United States:** Fragmented, agency-driven approach. **SEC** (securities focus), **CFTC** (commodities/derivatives), **FinCEN** (AML/CFT at federal level), and **State-level** (e.g., NYDFS BitLicense) regulations apply concurrently.
- **European Union:** **MiCA** is the upcoming central framework, superseding national regimes. Current AML/CFT under **AMLD5** is enforced nationally.
- **Singapore (MAS):** Licensing under the **Payment Services Act (PSA)**, with a strong focus on AML/CFT and technology risk management. Differentiates between payment tokens, security tokens, and utility tokens.
- **United Arab Emirates:** **VARA** (Dubai) and **FSRA** (ADGM) have progressive, activity-based licensing regimes with detailed rulebooks.
- **Japan (FSA):** Pioneering licensing system under the **Payment Services Act**, recognizing crypto as legal property. Strict custody and exchange operational requirements.

**5. Notable Enforcement Actions & Guidance**
- **SEC Enforcement:** High-profile cases against major exchanges (e.g., Coinbase, Binance) for alleged unregistered securities offerings and operation of unregistered exchanges.
- **OFAC Sanctions:** Designation of mixing services (e.g., Tornado Cash) and specific wallet addresses, emphasizing the need for robust blockchain analytics and sanctions screening.
- **Financial Penalties:** Major fines imposed globally for AML/CFT failures (e.g., Binance’s $4.3B settlement with U.S. authorities).
- **Regulatory Guidance:** Issuance of FAQs, interpretive letters, and policy statements by bodies like the **UK FCA**, **MAS**, and **IRS** (on tax treatment) to clarify application of existing rules.

**Overall Trend:** The regulatory environment is rapidly converging toward **mandatory licensing, enhanced AML/CFT frameworks, and clear consumer/investor protection rules**. The distinction between security and non-security tokens remains a critical, jurisdiction-specific determination. **Cross-border compliance is complex**, requiring mapping of obligations across all operational jurisdictions.

## Executive Summary
ZODIA Markets has developed a comprehensive Digital Operational Resilience Framework aligned with DORA requirements, demonstrating strong ICT risk management capabilities. However, critical regulatory gaps exist across fundamental areas required for VASP operation. The company lacks essential AML/CTF, licensing, securities, consumer protection, and market conduct frameworks. The current policy addresses only operational resilience (approximately 10% of the regulatory landscape), leaving 90% of key regulatory requirements unaddressed. Immediate action is required on AML/CTF and licensing gaps to achieve basic operational legality. The compliance program should be expanded from a single-policy approach to a comprehensive framework covering all regulatory obligations across operating jurisdictions.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Mandatory registration/licensing for VASPs with financial intelligence units. FATF Travel Rule compliance for originator/beneficiary information sharing.

**Current Status:** No policy addressing VASP licensing, AML/CTF registration, or Travel Rule implementation.

**Gap:** Complete absence of AML/CTF framework, licensing procedures, and Travel Rule compliance mechanisms.

**Impact:** Inability to legally operate as a VASP in most jurisdictions; severe regulatory penalties including fines, license revocation, and criminal liability for money laundering facilitation.

**Recommendation:** Immediately develop and implement a comprehensive AML/CTF program including: 1) Licensing strategy per jurisdiction (BitLicense, MAS PSA, VARA, etc.), 2) Travel Rule solution implementation, 3) Appointment of MLRO, 4) Customer identification program (CIP) and ongoing monitoring.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Robust KYC/CDD procedures including identity verification, customer due diligence, and ongoing monitoring.

**Current Status:** No KYC/CDD policy exists in the provided DORA framework.

**Gap:** Missing entire customer onboarding and monitoring framework required by AML regulations globally.

**Impact:** Failure to identify customers, assess risk, or monitor for suspicious activity; regulatory enforcement for AML failures; potential designation as high-risk institution.

**Recommendation:** Develop tiered KYC/CDD policy with risk-based approach: 1) Identity verification standards, 2) Enhanced due diligence for high-risk customers, 3) Ongoing transaction monitoring, 4) Source of funds/wealth verification procedures.

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Transaction monitoring and suspicious activity reporting (SARs/STRs) to financial intelligence units.

**Current Status:** Only ICT incident reporting addressed; no financial transaction monitoring or SAR reporting.

**Gap:** Missing financial crime monitoring systems and procedures for detecting/reporting suspicious transactions.

**Impact:** Failure to detect and report money laundering/terrorist financing; regulatory fines and loss of banking relationships.

**Recommendation:** Implement transaction monitoring system with: 1) Rule-based and behavioral analytics, 2) SAR filing procedures, 3) Investigation workflows, 4) Regulatory reporting timelines per jurisdiction.

## High Priority Gaps
