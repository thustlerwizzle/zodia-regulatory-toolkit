# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T20:29:38.387034

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no documented policies addressing any regulatory requirements for stablecoin operations. This represents a complete regulatory compliance failure across all essential domains. The company cannot legally operate a stablecoin business in Chad or most jurisdictions without addressing these fundamental gaps. Immediate action is required to develop comprehensive compliance frameworks before any further business development or operations. The most critical priorities are licensing, reserve management, and AML/CTF compliance, which are prerequisites for legal operation in any regulated market.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Legal authorization/licensing for stablecoin issuance and operation

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** Company lacks any documented policy addressing licensing requirements for stablecoin operations in Chad or other jurisdictions where services may be offered

**Impact:** Potential for regulatory enforcement actions, fines, business shutdown, and criminal liability for operating without proper authorization

**Recommendation:** 1. Conduct jurisdictional analysis to determine applicable licensing requirements. 2. Develop licensing acquisition strategy. 3. Create policy requiring regulatory approval before operations commence in any jurisdiction.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Reserve requirements and asset backing for stablecoins

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** No policy exists regarding reserve composition, custody, auditing, or transparency for stablecoin backing assets

**Impact:** Risk of regulatory sanctions, loss of consumer trust, potential insolvency if reserves are inadequate, and legal liability for misrepresentation

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop comprehensive reserve management policy. 2. Establish requirements for asset composition (cash, cash equivalents, government securities). 3. Implement regular third-party audit requirements. 4. Create public disclosure framework for reserve status.

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** Complete absence of AML/CTF policies, procedures, and controls required for financial services involving stablecoins

**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, potential criminal liability, loss of banking relationships, and inclusion on sanctions lists

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop comprehensive AML/CTF program. 2. Implement Customer Due Diligence (CDD) and Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures. 3. Establish transaction monitoring and suspicious activity reporting systems. 4. Designate AML compliance officer.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements

**Recommendation:** 1. Create comprehensive consumer protection policy. 2. Develop clear risk disclosure documents. 3. Establish redemption procedures and timelines. 4. Implement formal complaint resolution process.

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop comprehensive operational risk management framework. 2. Implement cybersecurity standards and protocols. 3. Create incident response and business continuity plans. 4. Establish regular security testing and audit requirements.

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Cross-border compliance and jurisdictional recognition

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop cross-border compliance framework. 2. Create jurisdiction assessment process. 3. Establish legal entity structure to manage multi-jurisdictional operations. 4. Implement geographic restrictions where necessary.
