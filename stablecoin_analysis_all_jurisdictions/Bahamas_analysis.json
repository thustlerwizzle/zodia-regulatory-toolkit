The current policy framework is essentially non-existent, creating critical vulnerabilities in licensing, reserve management, AML/CFT compliance, and consumer protection. Immediate action is required to develop comprehensive policies and procedures to meet the requirements of The Bahamas' DARE Act and associated regulations. Priority should be given to licensing applications, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance to mitigate the highest risks of regulatory enforcement and operational failure. The company is currently non-compliant and should not engage in stablecoin issuance activities until these fundamental gaps are addressed."

Purpose and Scope\n### Purpose\nThis policy establishes a formal framework for the management of reserves to ensure full backing of all relevant liabilities with high-quality liquid assets. The policy is designed to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, safeguard customer funds, and maintain institutional liquidity and solvency.\n\n### Scope\nThis policy applies to all departments, personnel, and third-party service providers involved in the identification, valuation, custody, and reporting of reserve assets. It governs all activities related to the reserve portfolio held to back designated liabilities.\n\n## 3. Definitions\n*   **Full Backing:** The requirement to hold reserve assets with a real-time market value equal to or exceeding the aggregate value of all relevant customer liabilities.\n*   **High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA):** Assets that are readily convertible to cash with minimal loss of value, as defined in Section 5.1 of this policy.\n*   **Eligible Assets:** Specific HQLA approved for inclusion in the reserve portfolio.\n*   **Reserve Portfolio:** The aggregate of all eligible assets held specifically to meet the full backing requirement.\n*   **Custodian:** A regulated, independent third-party financial institution responsible for the safekeeping of reserve assets.\n*   **Segregation:** The legal and operational separation of reserve assets from the company's operating assets, ensuring they are held for the sole benefit of customers and are not available to company creditors.\n*   **Third-Party Attestation:** An independent examination and report by a qualified external auditor verifying compliance with this policy.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\nIt is the policy of [Company Name] to maintain at all times a reserve of eligible high-quality liquid assets that is equal to or exceeds 100% of the aggregate value of its relevant customer liabilities. These reserve assets shall be segregated from corporate assets, held with approved custodians, and subject to independent verification to ensure perpetual compliance with regulatory obligations and to protect customer interests.\n\n## 5. Procedures\n\n### 5.1. Eligibility and Composition of Reserve Assets\nThe Reserve Portfolio must consist exclusively of the following **Eligible Assets**:\n*   **Cash:** Bahamian Dollars (BSD) held in dedicated accounts at approved domestic financial institutions.\n*   **Foreign Currency Cash:** Major convertible currencies (e.g., USD, EUR, GBP) held in dedicated accounts at approved international financial institutions with strong credit ratings (minimum A- from S&P or equivalent).\n*   **Short-Term Government Securities:** Debt instruments issued by sovereign governments with a credit rating of AA- or higher, with remaining maturities of 90 days or less.\n*   **Central Bank Reserves:** Deposits held directly with the Central Bank of The Bahamas.\n*   **Other Approved Assets:** Any other asset class must receive prior written approval from the Chief Compliance Officer and the Board Risk Committee before inclusion.\n\n### 5.2.

These accounts shall be designated as \"Customer Reserve Trust Accounts\" or similar.\n*   **Operational Segregation:** Internal accounting and ledger systems must clearly and separately identify the Reserve Portfolio. Transfers between reserve and operating accounts are strictly prohibited except for:\n    *   The initial allocation of assets to the reserve.\n    *   Rebalancing of the portfolio to maintain eligibility and value.\n    *   Any release of excess reserves, which requires dual authorization from the CFO and Chief Compliance Officer.\n\n### 5.4.

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Bahamas\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-01-30T06:12:36.492459\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company exhibits significant regulatory compliance gaps across all major areas of Bahamian stablecoin regulation. The current policy framework is essentially non-existent, creating critical vulnerabilities in licensing, reserve management, AML/CFT compliance, and consumer protection. Immediate action is required to develop comprehensive policies and procedures to meet the requirements of The Bahamas' DARE Act and associated regulations. Priority should be given to licensing applications, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance to mitigate the highest risks of regulatory enforcement and operational failure. The company is currently non-compliant and should not engage in stablecoin issuance activities until these fundamental gaps are addressed.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Licensing requirement for stablecoin issuers under the Digital Assets and Registered Exchanges (DARE) Act 2020\n\n**Current Status:** No documented licensing policy or application process\n\n**Gap:** Company lacks policies addressing the mandatory licensing framework for stablecoin issuance in The Bahamas, including application requirements, capital adequacy, and ongoing regulatory reporting\n\n**Impact:** Operating without proper licensing could result in regulatory enforcement actions, fines, business suspension, and reputational damage\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive licensing policy outlining application process, documentation requirements, capital requirements, and engagement strategy with the Securities Commission of The Bahamas\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Full backing requirement with high-quality liquid assets (Bahamian dollars, foreign currency, or other approved assets)\n\n**Current Status:** No documented reserve management policy\n\n**Gap:** Missing policies governing reserve composition, custody arrangements, segregation of assets, and regular attestation/audit requirements\n\n**Impact:** Failure to maintain proper reserves could lead to insolvency risk, loss of customer funds, and regulatory sanctions including license revocation\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish reserve management policy specifying eligible assets, custody arrangements, segregation requirements, and third-party attestation procedures\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-006\n**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (CFT) compliance under Bahamian regulations\n\n**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT policies\n\n**Gap:** Missing customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and record-keeping procedures required for virtual asset service providers\n\n**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, potential criminal liability, loss of banking relationships, and inclusion on international watchlists\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish comprehensive AML/CFT program including KYC procedures, transaction monitoring systems, suspicious activity reporting protocols, and staff training\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Redemption rights at par value for stablecoin holders\n\n**Recommendation:** Create redemption policy detailing procedures, timelines, fees, customer communication protocols, and contingency plans for high-volume redemption scenarios\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Transparency and disclosure requirements including regular reporting of reserve composition\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement disclosure framework including monthly reserve attestations, quarterly financial reporting, and public transparency dashboard\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Risk management framework including operational, liquidity, and cybersecurity risks\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop enterprise-wide risk management framework with specific modules for stablecoin operations, including stress testing, incident response, and business continuity planning\n\n### Gap 4: GAP-008\n**Requirement:** Governance requirements including board oversight and senior management responsibility\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish governance framework with board-level oversight committee, clear management responsibilities, and regular compliance reporting to the board\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **licensing_requirements**: not_met\n❌
