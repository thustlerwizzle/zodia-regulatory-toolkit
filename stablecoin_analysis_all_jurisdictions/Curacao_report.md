# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-11T21:15:48.698090

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no documented policies addressing Curacao's stablecoin regulatory requirements. All essential regulatory areas show 'not met' status, indicating the company is operating without basic compliance infrastructure. Immediate action is required to address critical gaps in licensing, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance before commencing or continuing stablecoin operations in Curacao. The absence of policies creates significant legal, financial, and reputational risks that could threaten business viability.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance requires licensing under Curacao's National Ordinance on the Supervision of Banking and Credit Institutions or similar financial services legislation

**Current Status:** No documented policy for stablecoin issuance or licensing requirements

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing licensing requirements for stablecoin operations in Curacao

**Impact:** Operating without proper license could result in regulatory enforcement, fines, business suspension, and reputational damage

**Recommendation:** Immediately engage legal counsel specializing in Curacao financial regulation to determine applicable licensing requirements and develop a licensing application strategy

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must maintain adequate reserves to back all issued tokens (typically 1:1 with high-quality liquid assets)

**Current Status:** No reserve management policy exists

**Gap:** Missing policies for reserve composition, custody, auditing, and transparency requirements

**Impact:** Inadequate reserves could lead to stablecoin depegging, loss of consumer confidence, and regulatory sanctions

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive reserve management policy including: 1) Acceptable reserve assets, 2) Custody arrangements, 3) Regular third-party audits, 4) Public disclosure framework

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance under Curacao's National Ordinance on the Reporting of Unusual Transactions and the FATF recommendations

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT policies for stablecoin operations

**Gap:** Missing customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and record-keeping procedures

**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, potential criminal liability, and exclusion from the global financial system

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive AML/CFT program including: KYC procedures, transaction monitoring systems, designated compliance officer, and regular staff training

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including clear disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling

**Recommendation:** Develop consumer protection framework including: 1) Clear terms of service, 2) Redemption policy, 3) Complaint handling procedures, 4) Risk disclosures

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Cybersecurity and operational resilience requirements for digital asset services

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive cybersecurity framework including: multi-sig wallet protocols, cold storage policies, incident response plan, and regular security audits
