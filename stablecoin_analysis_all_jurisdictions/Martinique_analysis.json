No policies exist to address the comprehensive regulatory framework under EU MiCA Regulation, AML/CFT directives, consumer protection rules, or data privacy requirements. Immediate action is required to develop a complete regulatory compliance program before any stablecoin operations can commence. The priority should be establishing the foundational authorization requirements under MiCA and implementing AML/CFT controls, followed by consumer protection and operational resilience frameworks. Given Martinique's status as an EU outermost region, all EU financial services regulations apply directly, creating significant regulatory exposure."

Purpose and Scope\n### 2.1 Purpose\nThis policy establishes a comprehensive framework for the protection of personal data collected, processed, and stored in connection with stablecoin services. It ensures compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), relevant local data privacy regulations, and addresses the unique considerations of cryptocurrency operations.\n\n### 2.2 Scope\nThis policy applies to:\n- All personal data processed by [Company Name] in relation to stablecoin issuance, redemption, transaction processing, wallet management, and user account services.\n- All employees, contractors, consultants, temporary staff, and third-party service providers who handle such data.\n- All processing activities, regardless of the geographic location of the data subject or the processing, where the processing relates to offering goods or services to individuals in the EU/EEA or monitoring their behavior.\n- Both on-chain and off-chain data processing activities.\n\n## 3. Definitions\n- **Personal Data:** Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'), including wallet addresses, transaction hashes (when linked to an identity), Know Your Customer (KYC) information, IP addresses, and device identifiers.\n- **Processing:** Any operation performed on personal data, including collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure, dissemination, combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction.\n- **Data Subject:** The individual user of stablecoin services to whom the personal data relates.\n- **Controller:** [Company Name], which determines the purposes and means of processing personal data.\n- **Processor:** A third party that processes personal data on behalf of the Controller.\n- **Stablecoin User Data:** A subset of personal data specifically generated through interactions with stablecoin protocols, wallets, and services, including but not limited to blockchain transaction records linked to an identity.\n- **Cross-Border Transfer:** The transmission of personal data to a recipient in a country outside the jurisdiction where it was collected.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\n[Company Name] is committed to protecting the privacy and security of all personal data, especially stablecoin user data. We recognize the heightened sensitivity and unique risks associated with processing financial and transactional data on distributed ledgers. We process personal data lawfully, fairly, and transparently. We adhere to the principles of data minimization, purpose limitation, accuracy, storage limitation, integrity, confidentiality, and accountability as mandated by GDPR and applicable local regulations.\n\n## 5. Procedures\n\n### 5.1 Lawful Basis for Processing\nAll processing of stablecoin user data must be supported by at least one lawful basis under Article 6 GDPR:\n- **Performance of a Contract:** For processing necessary to execute a transaction, maintain a wallet, or fulfill terms of service.\n- **Legal Obligation:** For processing required to comply with AML/CFT, sanctions, or other financial regulations (e.g., KYC verification).\n- **Legitimate Interests:** For processing necessary for network security, fraud prevention, or service improvement, provided such interests are not overridden by the user's fundamental rights. A Legitimate Interest Assessment (LIA) must be documented.\n- **Consent:** Used only where no other basis applies. Consent must be freely given, specific, informed, unambiguous, and revocable. For on-chain transactions, the immutable nature of the blockchain will be clearly communicated prior to consent.\n\n### 5.2 Data Minimization and Purpose Limitation\n- Collect only personal data that is adequate, relevant, and strictly necessary for the specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes.\n- On-chain data must be carefully evaluated; where possible, pseudonymous identifiers should be used instead of directly identifying information.\n- The purposes for data collection will be communicated to users at the point of collection via privacy notices.\n\n### 5.3 User Rights Management\nWe will facilitate the following data subject rights in a manner compatible with the immutable and transparent nature of blockchain technology:\n- **Right to Access:** Provide a clear record of the personal data held, including relevant on-chain transaction identifiers.\n- **Right to Rectification:** Correct inaccurate off-chain data promptly. The feasibility of altering on-chain data will be communicated transparently (typically not possible).\n- **Right to Erasure ('Right to be Forgotten'):** Delete or anonymize off-chain data where applicable. A clear process will outline the limitations regarding immutable blockchain records.\n- **Right to Restrict Processing:** Temporarily halt processing of off-chain data under certain conditions.\n- **Right to Data Portability:** Provide personal data provided by the user in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format (e.g., for KYC data).\n- **Right to Object:** Allow users to object to processing based on legitimate interests.\n- Procedures for verifying the identity of the requester (to prevent unauthorized access) will be implemented without compromising wallet security.\n\n### 5.4 Cross-Border Data Transfers\n- Transfers of personal data outside the European Economic Area (EEA) will only occur if an appropriate safeguard is in place, such as:\n    - An adequacy decision by the European Commission.\n    - Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) supplemented by a Transfer Impact Assessment (TIA).\n    - Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs).\n- The global and decentralized nature of blockchain networks will be assessed for transfer implications, and risks will be mitigated to the extent possible.\n\n### 5.5 Security Measures for Personal Data\nTechnical and organizational measures will include:\n- **Encryption:** Data at rest and in transit using strong, industry-standard cryptography.\n- **Pseudonymization:** Applying this technique to datasets, especially for analytics, where feasible.\n- **Access Controls:** Strict role-based access controls (RBAC), multi-factor authentication (MFA), and principle of least privilege for systems holding personal data.\n- **Key Management:** Secure, segregated management of private keys, distinct from database access credentials.\n- **Blockchain-Specific Security:** Secure integration with smart contracts and nodes; monitoring for unauthorized on-chain activity linking to user identities.\n- **Incident Response:** A dedicated Data Breach Response Plan for personal data breaches, including procedures for notifying supervisory authorities and data subjects within 72 hours where required.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n- **Data Protection Officer (DPO):** A DPO has been appointed and is responsible for overseeing this policy.\n- **Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs):** A DPIA is mandatory prior to launching new stablecoin products, services, or processing activities that involve novel technology or are likely to result in a high risk to users' rights and freedoms.\n- **Record of Processing Activities (RoPA):** Maintain a detailed RoPA as required by Article 30 GDPR.\n- **Third-Party Processor Management:** All processors (e.g., cloud hosts, analytics providers) must be bound by a GDPR-compliant Data Processing Agreement (DPA).\n- **Training:** All personnel handling stablecoin user data must undergo annual data protection and crypto-specific privacy training.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule\nThis policy shall be reviewed and updated:\n- Annually, as a standard procedure.\n- Following any significant change in relevant data protection laws or regulations.\n- Following a significant data incident or breach.\n- Upon the launch of a new stablecoin product, service, or technology that materially alters data processing activities.\n- Version control will be maintained for all updates.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements\nThis policy is designed to ensure compliance with, but not limited to, the following regulations:\n- **Regulation (EU) 2016/679:** The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n- **Local Implementations:** e.g., UK GDPR, Data Protection Act 2018.\n- **Sector-Specific Regulations:** Applicable financial regulatory frameworks requiring data processing (e.g., AML directives).\n- **Guidance from Supervisory Authorities:** Relevant opinions and guidelines from the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) and national supervisory authorities concerning blockchain and virtual assets.\n\n---\n**Policy Owner:** Data Protection Officer  \n**Effective Date:** [Date]  \n**Version:** 1.0  \n**Approved By:** [Name/Title of Approving Authority]\n```"

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Martinique\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-02-12T16:44:53.290965\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company exhibits complete non-compliance with stablecoin regulatory requirements applicable in Martinique. No policies exist to address the comprehensive regulatory framework under EU MiCA Regulation, AML/CFT directives, consumer protection rules, or data privacy requirements. Immediate action is required to develop a complete regulatory compliance program before any stablecoin operations can commence. The priority should be establishing the foundational authorization requirements under MiCA and implementing AML/CFT controls, followed by consumer protection and operational resilience frameworks. Given Martinique's status as an EU outermost region, all EU financial services regulations apply directly, creating significant regulatory exposure.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance and operation must comply with EU MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) Regulation, which applies to Martinique as an EU outermost region.\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policies for stablecoin operations\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing stablecoin issuance, redemption, reserve management, or governance as required under MiCA.\n\n**Impact:** Legal prohibition of stablecoin operations, potential regulatory enforcement actions, fines, and reputational damage.\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive stablecoin policy framework aligned with MiCA requirements including: authorization process, reserve asset requirements (full backing with high-quality liquid assets), redemption rights, governance, and disclosure obligations.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance under EU AML Directives (5AMLD/6AMLD) and local Martinique regulations requiring KYC, transaction monitoring, and reporting.\n\n**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT policies for crypto-asset operations\n\n**Gap:** Missing AML/CFT framework specifically addressing stablecoin transactions, customer due diligence, and suspicious activity reporting.\n\n**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, potential criminal liability, loss of banking relationships, and business shutdown.\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement crypto-specific AML/CFT program including: risk assessment, KYC/CDD procedures for stablecoin users, transaction monitoring systems, and reporting mechanisms to French authorities (TRACFIN).\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection requirements including clear disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling procedures.\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish consumer protection framework with: clear terms of service, risk disclosures, redemption policy, complaint handling procedures, and customer education materials.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity requirements for critical financial infrastructure.\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop operational resilience framework including: cybersecurity standards, incident response plan, business continuity planning, and regular penetration testing.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Governance and risk management requirements including board oversight, internal controls, and independent audits.\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish governance framework with: board oversight committee, risk management policy, internal control procedures, and requirement for independent annual audits of reserve assets.\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **MiCA stablecoin authorization requirements**: not_met\n❌ **Reserve management and backing requirements**: not_met\n❌ **AML/CFT compliance**: not_met\n❌ **Consumer protection disclosures**: not_met\n❌ **Operational resilience requirements**: not_met\n❌ **Governance and risk management**: not_met\n❌ **Data protection compliance**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update Summary\nGenerated: 2026-02-12T16:45:34.466287\n\n## Overview\nThis document summarizes proposed
