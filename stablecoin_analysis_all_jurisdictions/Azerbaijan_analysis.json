Policy Title\nStablecoin Issuance and Management: Operational Risk Management and Cybersecurity Policy\n\n## 2. Purpose and Scope\n### 2.1 Purpose\nThis policy establishes a comprehensive framework to identify, assess, monitor, and mitigate operational risks—with a primary focus on cybersecurity—associated with the issuance, redemption, and management of stablecoins. The policy ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and data, safeguards customer assets, and maintains operational resilience in alignment with regulatory expectations and industry best practices.\n\n### 2.2 Scope\nThis policy applies to:\n*   All personnel (employees, contractors, and third-party vendors) involved in stablecoin operations.\n*   All information systems, networks, software, and data used in the development, issuance, management, and redemption of stablecoins.\n*   All operational processes supporting stablecoin activities, including but not limited to minting, burning, wallet management, reserve management, and transaction processing.\n*   The entire organization, with specific procedures detailed for Technology, Risk, Compliance, and Operations departments.\n\n## 3. Definitions\n*   **Business Continuity Plan (BCP):** A documented strategy to ensure the continuation or rapid recovery of critical business functions following a disruptive incident.\n*   **Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP):** A documented process for recovering IT infrastructure, systems, and data after a major outage or disaster.\n*   **Key Management:** The full lifecycle administration of cryptographic keys, including generation, storage, distribution, rotation, archival, and destruction.\n*   **Operational Risk:** The risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems, or from external events.\n*   **Stablecoin Operations:** All activities related to the issuance, governance, reserve management, minting, burning, redemption, and transaction validation of the organization's stablecoin(s).\n*   **Zero-Trust Architecture:** A security model that requires strict identity verification for every person and device trying to access resources on a private network, regardless of whether they are inside or outside the network perimeter.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\nIt is the policy of [Organization Name] to maintain a robust operational risk management program specifically designed for its stablecoin operations. The organization is committed to:\n1.  Protecting the stability, security, and redeemability of its stablecoin(s) through proactive risk identification and mitigation.\n2.  Implementing and maintaining a cybersecurity framework that adheres to the principles of defense-in-depth and zero-trust.\n3.  Ensuring resilience through tested Business Continuity (BCP) and Disaster Recovery (DRP) Plans.\n4.  Enforcing stringent cryptographic key management procedures to prevent unauthorized access or loss of assets.\n5.  Continuously monitoring operational risk indicators and adapting controls to address evolving threats.\n6.  Complying with all applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards governing digital assets and financial services.\n\n## 5.
