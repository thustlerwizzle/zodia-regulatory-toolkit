This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Aruba\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-02-11T21:11:59.083410\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company is in a state of total non-compliance with the foundational regulatory requirements for operating a stablecoin in Aruba. No policies exist to address core areas such as licensing, reserve backing, AML/CFT, or consumer protection. Operating in this state carries extreme legal, financial, and reputational risk. Immediate action is required to cease any operational activity and begin a comprehensive compliance program build-out, starting with securing legal advice and addressing the critical licensing and reserve management gaps.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance requires licensing/registration with Aruban financial authorities (Central Bank of Aruba/CBA).\n\n**Current Status:** No policy exists for licensing or regulatory registration.\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of any framework or procedure for obtaining necessary licenses to issue or operate stablecoin services in Aruba.\n\n**Impact:** Operating without a license is illegal, leading to immediate enforcement action, fines, seizure of operations, and criminal liability for directors.\n\n**Recommendation:** Immediately halt any stablecoin-related operations. Engage legal counsel in Aruba to initiate the licensing application process with the CBA and develop a Licensing & Registration Policy.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must maintain 1:1 high-quality liquid asset (HQLA) reserves, segregated from company assets, with regular independent attestation/audit.\n\n**Current Status:** No policy exists for reserve management, custody, or attestation.\n\n**Gap:** No governance over the backing assets, creating risk of insolvency and commingling of funds. No process for independent verification exists.\n\n**Impact:** Risk of a 'break-the-buck' event leading to loss of consumer funds, loss of trust, regulatory sanctions, and potential collapse of the stablecoin.\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop a comprehensive Reserve Management & Custody Policy mandating 100% HQLA backing in segregated accounts. Establish contracts with qualified custodians and a schedule for monthly attestations and annual audits by a registered public accountant.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Adherence to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) regulations, including KYC, CDD, transaction monitoring, and reporting to FIU Aruba.\n\n**Current Status:** No AML/CFT policy exists.\n\n**Gap:** Complete lack of procedures for customer identification, ongoing due diligence, suspicious activity monitoring, or regulatory reporting.\n\n**Impact:** High risk of facilitating financial crime, leading to severe regulatory penalties, loss of banking relationships, and reputational destruction.\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop and implement a full AML/CFT Program compliant with Aruba's National Ordinance on the Reporting of Unusual Transactions and FATF standards. Integrate a transaction monitoring system and appoint a dedicated AML Officer.\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Clear, fair disclosure to users regarding terms of service, redemption rights, risks, and the nature of the reserve assets.\n\n**Recommendation:** Create a Consumer Disclosure & Transparency Policy. Draft public terms of service and a stablecoin 'white paper' detailing the operational model, redemption process, and associated risks, approved by legal counsel.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Implementation of robust cybersecurity and operational resilience measures to protect systems and customer data.\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop an Information Security & Operational Resilience Policy based on a framework like NIST or ISO 27001. Implement strong access controls, cold wallet storage for reserves, and regular penetration testing.\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **licensing_and_registration**: not_met\n❌ **reserve_management_and_custody**: not_met\n❌ **aml_cft_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **consumer_protection_and_disclosure**: not_met\n❌ **cybersecurity_and_resilience**: not_met\n❌ **governance_and_risk_management**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update Summary\nGenerated: 2026-02-11T21:12:28.731614\n\n## Overview\nThis document summarizes proposed updates to company policies and standards based on regulatory gap analysis.\n\n## New Policies Required\n\n## Modified Policies\n\n### GAP-001\n**Category:** Compliance\n**Current Policy:** No policy exists for licensing or regulatory registration.\n**Proposed Change:** Immediately halt any stablecoin-related operations. Engage legal counsel in Aruba to initiate the licensing application process with the CBA and develop a Licensing & Registration Policy.\n\n### GAP-002\n**Category:** Compliance\n**Current Policy:** No policy exists for reserve management, custody, or attestation.\n**Proposed Change:** Develop a comprehensive Reserve Management & Custody Policy mandating 100% HQLA backing in segregated accounts. Establish contracts with qualified custodians and a schedule for monthly attestations and annual audits by a registered public accountant.\n\n### GAP-003\n**Category:** AML/KYC\n**Current Policy:** No AML/CFT policy exists.\n**Proposed Change:** Develop and implement a full AML/CFT Program compliant with Aruba's National Ordinance on the Reporting of Unusual Transactions and FATF standards. Integrate a transaction monitoring system and appoint a dedicated AML Officer.\n\n### GAP-004\n**Category:** Risk Management\n**Current Policy:** No disclosure or consumer protection policy exists.\n**Proposed Change:** Create a Consumer Disclosure & Transparency Policy. Draft public terms of service and a stablecoin 'white paper' detailing the operational model, redemption process, and associated risks, approved by legal counsel.\n\n### GAP-005\n**Category:** Data Protection\n**Current Policy:** No cybersecurity or operational resilience policy exists.\n**Proposed Change:** Develop an Information Security & Operational Resilience Policy based on a framework like NIST or ISO 27001. Implement strong access controls, cold wallet storage for reserves, and regular penetration testing.\n\n### GAP-006\n**Category:** Risk Management\n**Current Policy:** No governance or risk management policy exists.\n**Proposed Change:** Establish a Corporate Governance & Risk Management Policy. Define a three-lines-of-defense model, form a Risk and Compliance Committee, and initiate fit & proper checks for all key individuals.\n\n\n\n## Policy Implementation\n\n✅ **Automatically implemented 6 policies**\n\n📁 **Saved to:** C:\\Users\\takun\\Desktop\\Regulatory_Policies\n\n📄 **Summary file:** C:\\Users\\takun\\Desktop\\Regulatory_Policies\\IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md\n\n\n### Implemented Policies:\n\n- **GAP-001** (Compliance) - Compliance_GAP-001.md\n\n- **GAP-002** (Compliance) - Compliance_GAP-002.md\n\n- **GAP-003** (AML/KYC) - AML_KYC_GAP-003.md\n\n- **GAP-004** (Risk Management) - Risk Management_GAP-004.md\n\n- **GAP-005** (Data Protection) - Data Protection_GAP-005.md\n\n- **GAP-006** (Risk Management) - Risk Management_GAP-006.md\n\n\n"
