As a French overseas department, Mayotte falls under EU MiCA regulations and French financial regulations. The complete absence of policies creates severe legal, operational, and reputational risks. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive regulatory compliance framework before any stablecoin operations can be considered. Priority should be given to licensing requirements, AML/CTF compliance, and reserve management policies, as these represent the most critical regulatory obligations with the highest potential for enforcement actions."

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Mayotte\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-02-12T16:50:47.167771\n\n## Executive Summary\nCRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no documented policies addressing stablecoin regulatory requirements for Mayotte jurisdiction. As a French overseas department, Mayotte falls under EU MiCA regulations and French financial regulations. The complete absence of policies creates severe legal, operational, and reputational risks. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive regulatory compliance framework before any stablecoin operations can be considered. Priority should be given to licensing requirements, AML/CTF compliance, and reserve management policies, as these represent the most critical regulatory obligations with the highest potential for enforcement actions.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Legal framework for stablecoin issuance and operation in Mayotte (French overseas department subject to EU/FR regulations)\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policies for stablecoin operations\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing stablecoin regulatory requirements in Mayotte jurisdiction\n\n**Impact:** Legal exposure, potential regulatory sanctions, inability to operate legally in Mayotte, reputational damage\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive stablecoin policy framework aligned with EU MiCA regulations and French financial regulations applicable to Mayotte\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Licensing requirements for stablecoin issuers under EU Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation\n\n**Current Status:** No licensing or authorization procedures documented\n\n**Gap:** Missing procedures for obtaining required licenses/authorizations for stablecoin issuance\n\n**Impact:** Illegal operations, regulatory enforcement actions, fines, and potential criminal liability\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish licensing compliance program including application procedures, capital requirements, and ongoing reporting obligations\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Reserve requirements and asset backing for stablecoins (MiCA Article 31-35)\n\n**Current Status:** No reserve management or asset backing policies\n\n**Gap:** Lack of policies governing reserve composition, custody, audit, and redemption mechanisms\n\n**Impact:** Failure to maintain adequate reserves could lead to insolvency, consumer harm, and regulatory intervention\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement reserve management policy with segregation requirements, regular audits, and transparent reporting\n\n### Gap 4: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance (EU AMLD5/6)\n\n**Current Status:** No AML/CTF policies documented\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of KYC, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting procedures\n\n**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, loss of banking relationships, potential criminal prosecution\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement full AML/CTF program including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and reporting to French TRACFIN\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements (MiCA Title III)\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive disclosure framework including whitepaper requirements, risk disclosures, and complaint handling procedures\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-006\n**Requirement:** Governance and risk management requirements (MiCA Article 34)\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish governance framework with clear roles, risk management policies, and internal control procedures\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-007\n**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity requirements\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop operational resilience framework including cybersecurity measures, incident response, and business continuity planning\n\n## Compliance
