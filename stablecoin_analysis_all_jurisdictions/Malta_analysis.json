All critical regulatory requirements under the MFSA VFA Rulebook and related legislation remain unaddressed. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive compliance framework before any stablecoin operations can commence in Malta. The current state represents high regulatory risk and would prevent successful licensing application or lawful operation. Priority should be given to establishing core governance, AML/CTF, and reserve management policies as foundational elements.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** MFSA VFA Rulebook requirements for stablecoin issuers including governance, risk management, capital requirements, and consumer protection\n\n**Current Status:** No documented stablecoin-specific policies

operations documented\n\n**Gap:** Missing customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting procedures for stablecoin transactions\n\n**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties, potential criminal liability, and inclusion in international watchlists\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive AML/CTF program specifically designed for stablecoin operations, including KYC procedures and transaction monitoring\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** MFSA licensing requirements for VFA service providers (Part B of VFA Act)\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop licensing compliance framework and conduct readiness assessment for MFSA VFA Service Provider license application\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection requirements including clear disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling (MFSA Conduct of Business Rules)\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop consumer protection framework including clear disclosures, redemption policies, and complaint handling procedures\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-006\n**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity requirements (MFSA Technology Arrangements Guidelines)\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish comprehensive cybersecurity and operational resilience framework including penetration testing, incident response plans, and smart contract audits\n\n##
