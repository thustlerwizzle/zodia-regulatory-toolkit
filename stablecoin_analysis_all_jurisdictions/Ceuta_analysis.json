Based on standard EU/Spain regulatory frameworks (including MiCA provisions), all essential regulatory domains show non-compliance status. Immediate action is required to develop comprehensive policies, particularly for authorization, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance. The absence of any current policies suggests the company may be operating without necessary regulatory approvals, creating significant legal and financial risks. A phased implementation approach is recommended, starting with critical authorization and reserve policies, followed by consumer protection and operational controls."

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Ceuta\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-02-12T17:47:38.194867\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company exhibits critical compliance deficiencies with no documented policies addressing stablecoin regulatory requirements. Based on standard EU/Spain regulatory frameworks (including MiCA provisions), all essential regulatory domains show non-compliance status. Immediate action is required to develop comprehensive policies, particularly for authorization, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance. The absence of any current policies suggests the company may be operating without necessary regulatory approvals, creating significant legal and financial risks. A phased implementation approach is recommended, starting with critical authorization and reserve policies, followed by consumer protection and operational controls.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance requires authorization from relevant financial authorities (Ceuta likely follows EU/Spain frameworks like MiCA)\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy for stablecoin issuance authorization\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policy addressing regulatory authorization requirements for issuing or operating stablecoins\n\n**Impact:** Potential regulatory enforcement actions, fines, license revocation, and criminal liability for unauthorized financial activities\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive stablecoin issuance policy requiring pre-approval from relevant authorities, including application procedures and compliance monitoring\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must maintain adequate reserves (typically 1:1 liquid assets) with regular independent audits\n\n**Current Status:** No reserve management or audit policy exists\n\n**Gap:** Missing framework for reserve composition, custody, valuation, and independent verification\n\n**Impact:** Risk of insolvency, loss of consumer funds, regulatory sanctions, and loss of market confidence\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement reserve management policy specifying eligible assets, custody arrangements, daily valuation, and quarterly independent audits\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting\n\n**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT program for stablecoin operations\n\n**Gap:** Lack of risk-based AML/CFT controls specific to stablecoin transactions and customer onboarding\n\n**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties, potential loss of banking relationships, and reputational damage\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop stablecoin-specific AML/CFT program including KYC procedures, transaction monitoring rules, and SAR reporting protocols\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including redemption rights, disclosures, and complaint handling\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish consumer protection policy with clear redemption procedures, comprehensive disclosures, and formal complaint handling process\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity requirements for payment systems\n\n**Recommendation:** Create operational resilience policy covering system availability, cybersecurity controls, incident response, and business continuity planning\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **authorization_requirements**: not_met\n❌ **reserve_management**: not_met\n❌ **aml_cft_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **consumer_protection**: not_met\n❌ **operational_resilience**: not_met\n❌
