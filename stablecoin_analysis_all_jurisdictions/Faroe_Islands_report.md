# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-07T10:41:28.077471

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently operates with no documented policies or compliance framework for stablecoin issuance in the Faroe Islands. All fundamental regulatory requirements are unmet, representing severe legal, operational, and reputational risks. Immediate cessation of operations is recommended until a comprehensive compliance program is developed and regulatory authorization obtained. The organization must prioritize establishing basic legal authorization and AML/CFT controls before any customer-facing activities can resume. This represents a complete regulatory framework gap requiring urgent executive attention and significant resource allocation.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must maintain 1:1 reserves in high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) with regular independent audits

**Current Status:** No documented reserve management policy exists

**Gap:** Complete absence of reserve management framework, audit requirements, or asset quality standards

**Impact:** Regulatory enforcement action, license revocation, financial penalties, loss of customer trust, potential insolvency

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive reserve management policy specifying: 1) Asset composition requirements (cash, government securities, etc.), 2) Segregation of customer funds, 3) Monthly independent attestations, 4) Quarterly full-scope audits by approved auditors

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must obtain authorization/license from Faroese Financial Supervisory Authority (Føroya Fjármálaeftirlit)

**Current Status:** No licensing framework or regulatory engagement policy

**Gap:** No documented process for regulatory licensing, ongoing reporting, or supervisory engagement

**Impact:** Operating illegally, immediate cease-and-desist orders, criminal liability for directors, inability to access banking services

**Recommendation:** 1) Immediately cease operations until licensing obtained, 2) Establish regulatory affairs function, 3) Develop licensing application roadmap, 4) Create ongoing reporting calendar for regulatory submissions

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance including customer due diligence (CDD), transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting

**Current Status:** No AML/CFT program documented

**Gap:** Missing entire anti-money laundering framework required for financial institutions

**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, criminal prosecution, loss of correspondent banking relationships, reputational damage

**Recommendation:** Implement full AML/CFT program including: 1) Risk assessment methodology, 2) Customer identification program (CIP), 3) Enhanced due diligence for high-risk customers, 4) Transaction monitoring system, 5) Designated compliance officer, 6) Annual independent testing

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including clear disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling

**Recommendation:** Develop consumer protection framework: 1) Clear terms of service and risk disclosures, 2) Guaranteed redemption at par value, 3) Formal complaint handling process, 4) Customer education materials, 5) Data protection protocols

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity requirements for payment systems

**Recommendation:** Establish operational resilience program: 1) Business impact analysis, 2) Disaster recovery and business continuity plans, 3) Cybersecurity framework (NIST/ISO), 4) Incident response plan, 5) Regular penetration testing

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Capital adequacy and liquidity requirements for financial institutions

**Recommendation:** Develop capital and liquidity management framework: 1) Minimum capital requirements based on risk profile, 2) Liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) monitoring, 3) Stress testing scenarios, 4) Capital conservation buffer
