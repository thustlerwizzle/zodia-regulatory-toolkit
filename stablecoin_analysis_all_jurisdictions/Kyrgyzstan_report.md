# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-31T07:13:03.053792

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no policies addressing stablecoin regulation in Kyrgyzstan, representing a complete regulatory vacuum. All identified regulatory requirements are unmet, with multiple critical gaps that would prevent legal operation. Immediate engagement with Kyrgyz regulatory authorities and legal counsel is essential before any stablecoin operations can commence. The highest priority must be given to determining legal classification, licensing requirements, and AML/CTF compliance, as these represent existential risks to the business. Given the nascent state of Kyrgyzstan's stablecoin regulation, the company should adopt a conservative approach, implementing policies that exceed minimum requirements to accommodate future regulatory developments.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Legal definition and classification of stablecoins under Kyrgyz financial law

**Current Status:** No policy exists

**Gap:** Company lacks any policy addressing how stablecoins are classified under Kyrgyz law (whether as payment instruments, securities, commodities, or other financial products)

**Impact:** Operating without clear legal classification exposes the company to regulatory enforcement, license revocation, fines, and potential criminal liability for operating unauthorized financial services

**Recommendation:** Engage Kyrgyz legal counsel to determine stablecoin classification under National Bank of Kyrgyzstan regulations and Financial Intelligence Service guidelines. Develop classification policy based on legal assessment.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Licensing requirements for stablecoin issuance or exchange services

**Current Status:** No licensing policy exists

**Gap:** No policy addresses whether the company requires specific licenses from Kyrgyz regulatory authorities to issue, trade, or custody stablecoins

**Impact:** Operating without required licenses could result in immediate shutdown, substantial penalties, and potential director liability

**Recommendation:** Conduct regulatory licensing assessment with local counsel. Develop licensing compliance policy and obtain necessary approvals before operations.

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance for virtual asset service providers

**Current Status:** No AML/CTF policy exists

**Gap:** Company lacks AML/CTF policies required for virtual asset service providers under Kyrgyz law, including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and reporting obligations

**Impact:** Exposes company to severe penalties from Kyrgyz Financial Intelligence Service, potential criminal prosecution, and reputational damage

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive AML/CTF policy aligned with Kyrgyz Financial Intelligence Service requirements, including KYC procedures, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Reserve requirements and asset backing for stablecoin issuers

**Recommendation:** Develop reserve management policy specifying asset types, custody arrangements, regular audits, and public disclosure requirements.

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive consumer protection policy including risk disclosures, redemption terms, fee schedules, and complaint resolution procedures.

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Cybersecurity and operational resilience standards

**Recommendation:** Implement cybersecurity framework aligned with international standards (ISO 27001, NIST) and develop incident response and business continuity plans.
