No policies exist to address fundamental regulatory obligations including licensing, reserve management, consumer protection, AML/CFT, operational resilience, or governance. This represents an extreme compliance risk that requires immediate and comprehensive remediation. The company must prioritize establishing a complete policy framework before engaging in any stablecoin-related activities in Madeira. Given the absence of specific Madeira regulations in the research results, the analysis assumes application of EU-level frameworks (particularly MiCA) and Portuguese financial regulations that would likely govern stablecoin activities in the autonomous region."

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Madeira\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-02-12T17:30:18.455378\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company exhibits complete non-compliance with stablecoin regulatory requirements in Madeira. No policies exist to address fundamental regulatory obligations including licensing, reserve management, consumer protection, AML/CFT, operational resilience, or governance. This represents an extreme compliance risk that requires immediate and comprehensive remediation. The company must prioritize establishing a complete policy framework before engaging in any stablecoin-related activities in Madeira. Given the absence of specific Madeira regulations in the research results, the analysis assumes application of EU-level frameworks (particularly MiCA) and Portuguese financial regulations that would likely govern stablecoin activities in the autonomous region.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance requires authorization/licensing from Madeira financial regulator (Assumed requirement based on EU/Portuguese financial services framework)\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy for stablecoin issuance authorization\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policy addressing licensing requirements for stablecoin issuance in Madeira jurisdiction\n\n**Impact:** Potential regulatory enforcement actions, fines, or prohibition of operations in Madeira\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop and implement a Stablecoin Issuance Authorization Policy that outlines licensing requirements, application procedures, and ongoing compliance obligations\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Reserve requirements for stablecoin issuers (assumed based on EU MiCA framework)\n\n**Current Status:** No documented reserve management or custody policies\n\n**Gap:** Missing policies governing reserve composition, custody arrangements, and regular auditing of reserve assets\n\n**Impact:** Risk of insufficient backing for stablecoins, loss of consumer confidence, and regulatory sanctions\n\n**Recommendation:** Create Reserve Management Policy specifying eligible reserve assets, custody requirements, segregation rules, and audit frequency\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance for stablecoin transactions\n\n**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT policies specific to stablecoin operations\n\n**Gap:** Absence of policies addressing transaction monitoring, customer due diligence, and suspicious activity reporting for stablecoin activities\n\n**Impact:** Significant regulatory enforcement risk, potential criminal liability, and loss of banking relationships\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop Stablecoin AML/CFT Policy incorporating transaction monitoring, KYC procedures, and SAR reporting requirements\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements for stablecoin holders\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement Consumer Protection Policy covering redemption procedures, fee schedules, risk disclosures, and complaint resolution mechanisms\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity requirements\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish Operational Resilience Policy covering system redundancy, incident response plans, and cybersecurity controls for stablecoin platforms\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **licensing_and_authorization**: not_met\n❌ **reserve_management**: not_met\n❌ **consumer_protection**: not_met\n❌ **aml_cft_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **operational_resilience**: not_met\n❌
