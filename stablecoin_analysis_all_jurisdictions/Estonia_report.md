# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T22:29:10.101488

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently exhibits complete non-compliance with Estonian regulatory requirements for stablecoin operations. All fundamental regulatory pillars are unaddressed, with particular critical gaps in AML/CFT registration and financial licensing. Immediate action is required to prevent severe regulatory consequences including license denial, substantial fines, and potential criminal liability. The company must prioritize FIU registration and AML framework development while simultaneously addressing licensing requirements and preparing for MiCA implementation. This represents a high-risk operational state requiring urgent executive attention and resource allocation.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Estonia's Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Prevention Act (MLTFPA) requires VASPs (Virtual Asset Service Providers) to register with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and implement comprehensive AML/CFT programs.

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT policy or registration status available.

**Gap:** Complete absence of AML/CFT framework, customer due diligence procedures, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting mechanisms required for stablecoin issuance or exchange services.

**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties including license revocation, substantial fines (up to €400,000 for legal entities), criminal liability for management, and potential business shutdown.

**Recommendation:** 1. Immediately initiate FIU registration process. 2. Develop and implement comprehensive AML/CFT policy including KYC/CDD procedures, transaction monitoring systems, and SAR reporting protocols. 3. Appoint AML compliance officer.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Payment Institutions and E-money Institutions Act requires authorization from the Financial Supervision Authority (FSA) for issuing e-money tokens (including certain stablecoins).

**Current Status:** No documented authorization or application process for e-money/payment institution license.

**Gap:** Lack of required licensing for stablecoin issuance that qualifies as e-money under Estonian law.

**Impact:** Operating without required license constitutes illegal activity, leading to enforcement actions, fines, and potential criminal prosecution.

**Recommendation:** 1. Determine if stablecoin qualifies as e-money under Estonian law. 2. If yes, immediately prepare and submit license application to FSA. 3. Develop interim compliance plan while awaiting authorization.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Estonian Securities Market Act may apply to stablecoins qualifying as transferable securities or other financial instruments.

**Recommendation:** 1. Conduct legal assessment of stablecoin structure against securities definitions. 2. If security-like features exist, implement prospectus requirements and investor protection measures. 3. Consult with Estonian financial regulator for classification.

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** EU Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) transitional requirements and future compliance obligations.

**Recommendation:** 1. Conduct MiCA gap analysis. 2. Develop implementation roadmap addressing governance, capital, custody, and disclosure requirements. 3. Establish MiCA compliance team.

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Data protection requirements under GDPR and Estonian Personal Data Protection Act.

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop comprehensive GDPR compliance program. 2. Implement data protection impact assessments. 3. Appoint Data Protection Officer if required.
