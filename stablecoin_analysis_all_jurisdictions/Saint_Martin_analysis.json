Purpose and Scope\n### 2.1 Purpose\nThis policy establishes a comprehensive framework to ensure that all issued stablecoins are fully backed by high-quality reserve assets at all times. It is designed to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements mandating full backing and regular independent audits, thereby maintaining trust, transparency, and financial integrity.\n\n### 2.2 Scope\nThis policy applies to:\n*   All stablecoin issuance activities of [Company Name].\n*   All personnel involved in treasury management, finance, compliance, and stablecoin operations.\n*   All third-party custodians, auditors, and service providers engaged in reserve management or verification.\n*   All assets designated as part of the stablecoin reserve portfolio.\n\n## 3.

It is our unequivocal policy that every stablecoin in circulation will be backed 1:1 by eligible, high-quality reserve assets. These reserves will be held securely with reputable custodians and subjected to rigorous daily internal verification and quarterly independent audits to provide verifiable proof of full backing to regulators, users, and the public.\n\n## 5. Procedures\n\n### 5.1 Acceptable Reserve Assets\nReserve assets must be comprised of:\n*   **Cash and Cash Equivalents:** Deposits held in segregated accounts at U.S. federally insured depository institutions or their equivalents in approved jurisdictions.\n*   **Short-Term U.S. Treasury Securities:** Direct obligations of the U.S. government with remaining maturities of 90 days or less.\n*   **Other High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA):** As may be pre-approved by the Chief Compliance Officer and Risk Committee, provided they are:\n    *   Rated A-1/P-1 or equivalent by a major credit rating agency.\n    *   Highly liquid with minimal market and credit risk.\n    *   Subject to prudent haircuts as determined by the Risk Committee.\n*   **Prohibited Assets:** Under no circumstances shall reserves include securities of [Company Name] or its affiliates, other cryptocurrencies, illiquid assets, or any asset with significant credit or market risk.\n\n### 5.2 Custody Arrangements\n*   All physical and digital reserve assets must be held with one or more qualified, regulated custodians pre-approved by the Board of Directors or its designated committee.\n*   Custody agreements must clearly establish a segregated, bankruptcy-remote structure for the benefit of stablecoin holders.\n*   [Company Name] must maintain direct, real-time access to custodial account statements and transaction records for verification purposes.\n*   A minimum of two senior officers (e.g., CFO and Chief Compliance Officer) must jointly authorize any movement of reserve assets.\n\n### 5.3 Daily Reserve Verification Procedures\n1.  **Data Aggregation:** By 9:00 AM each business day, the Treasury Department will:\n    *   Obtain the total circulating supply of stablecoins from the blockchain ledger.\n    *   Obtain the total market value of all reserve assets from custodian statements and trusted pricing sources.\n2.  **Calculation & Comparison:** The Treasury Manager will calculate the Reserve Ratio (Value of Assets / Face Value of Liabilities).\n3.  **Verification & Reporting:** The Reserve Ratio must be >= 100%. The results, along with supporting data, must be recorded in a secure log and a summary report must be distributed to the CFO, Chief Compliance Officer, and CEO.\n4.  **Breach Protocol:** If the Reserve Ratio falls below 100%, the Treasury Department must immediately notify the Executive Team and Risk Committee.

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Saint Martin\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-02-12T17:11:59.359080\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company currently has no documented policies addressing stablecoin regulatory requirements for Saint Martin. This represents a critical compliance failure with immediate regulatory risk. All fundamental regulatory requirements are unmet, creating significant exposure to enforcement actions, business suspension, and reputational damage. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive regulatory compliance program, beginning with licensing requirements and reserve management policies. The company should consider suspending any stablecoin operations until basic compliance frameworks are established and approved by regulatory authorities.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance requires licensing/registration with financial authorities in Saint Martin (likely under Central Bank of Curaçao and Sint Maarten jurisdiction)\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy for stablecoin issuance or regulatory registration\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing licensing requirements for stablecoin operations in Saint Martin\n\n**Impact:** Potential for regulatory enforcement actions, fines, business suspension, and reputational damage\n\n**Recommendation:** Immediately research and document specific licensing requirements from Central Bank of Curaçao and Sint Maarten. Develop a licensing application policy and timeline.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin reserves must be fully backed and subject to regular independent audits\n\n**Current Status:** No reserve management or audit policies documented\n\n**Gap:** Missing policies for reserve composition, custody, verification, and third-party audit requirements\n\n**Impact:** Risk of regulatory sanctions for operating unbacked stablecoins, loss of user trust, potential insolvency\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive reserve management policy specifying: 1) Acceptable reserve assets, 2) Custody arrangements, 3) Daily reserve verification procedures, 4) Quarterly independent audit requirements\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and reporting suspicious activities\n\n**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT policies specific to stablecoin operations\n\n**Gap:** Lack of tailored AML/CFT framework for stablecoin transactions, customer verification, and monitoring\n\n**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties, potential criminal liability, loss of banking relationships\n\n**Recommendation:** Create stablecoin-specific AML/CFT policy incorporating: 1) KYC procedures for wallet holders, 2) Transaction monitoring thresholds, 3) Suspicious activity reporting protocols, 4) Record-keeping requirements\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including disclosure requirements, redemption rights, and risk warnings\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop consumer protection policy covering: 1) Clear disclosure of stablecoin mechanics and risks, 2) Transparent redemption procedures, 3) Complaint handling process, 4) User fund protection measures\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity requirements for digital asset platforms\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish operational resilience framework including: 1) Cybersecurity standards, 2) Incident response plan, 3) Business continuity procedures, 4) Regular penetration testing requirements\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **licensing_registration**: not_met\n❌ **reserve_requirements**: not_met\n❌ **aml_cft_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **consumer_protection**: not_met\n❌ **operational_resilience**: not_met\n❌ **governance_framework**: not_met\n❌ **cross_border_compliance**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update Summary\nGenerated: 2026-02-12T17:12:40.894428\n\n## Overview\nThis document summarizes proposed updates to company policies and standards based on regulatory gap analysis.\n\n## New Policies Required\n\n## Modified Policies\n\n### GAP-001\n**Category:** Compliance\n**Current Policy:** No documented policy for stablecoin issuance or regulatory registration\n**Proposed Change:** Immediately research and document specific licensing requirements from Central Bank of Curaçao and Sint Maarten.
