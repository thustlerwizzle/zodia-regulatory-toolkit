This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Madagascar\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-02-06T00:30:05.591092\n\n## Executive Summary\nCRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no documented policies addressing stablecoin regulation in Madagascar. All regulatory requirements appear to be unmet based on available information. This represents an extreme compliance risk that requires immediate executive attention. The company should suspend any stablecoin operations in Madagascar until a comprehensive compliance framework is developed and approved. Priority should be given to understanding Madagascar's specific regulatory landscape through local legal counsel, as the research summary indicates limited information was obtained.

Develop comprehensive AML/CTF policy framework. 2. Implement customer identification and verification procedures. 3. Establish transaction monitoring systems. 4. Create suspicious activity reporting protocols.\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures for stablecoin users\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Develop consumer protection policy framework. 2. Create clear disclosure documents. 3. Establish complaint handling procedures. 4.
