Policy Title\nStablecoin Infrastructure Operational Risk and Cybersecurity Management Policy\n\n## 2. Purpose and Scope\n### Purpose\nThis policy establishes a comprehensive operational risk management framework to ensure the secure, resilient, and reliable operation of stablecoin infrastructure. It aims to protect assets, data, and systems from operational failures, cyber threats, and business disruptions, thereby maintaining trust and fulfilling regulatory obligations.\n\n### Scope\nThis policy applies to:\n- All technological systems, networks, and software supporting stablecoin issuance, redemption, transfer, and storage.\n- All personnel (employees, contractors, and third-party providers) involved in the design, development, operation, or maintenance of stablecoin infrastructure.\n- All business processes and partnerships critical to stablecoin operations.\n- The policy covers both centralized and decentralized architectural components under the organization's control or influence.\n\n## 3. Definitions\n- **Operational Risk:** The risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems, or from external events.\n- **Stablecoin Infrastructure:** The ensemble of hardware, software, networks, data, procedures, and personnel that enable the creation, distribution, and management of a stablecoin.\n- **Critical Business Processes:** Processes whose failure would materially impact the ability to issue, redeem, or validate stablecoin transactions.\n- **Business Continuity Planning (BCP):** A proactive process to ensure critical business functions continue during and after a disruption.\n- **Disaster Recovery (DR):** The technical component of BCP focused on restoring IT systems and data access.\n- **Custody:** The safeguarding of cryptographic private keys or other instruments that control stablecoin reserves or minting capabilities.\n- **Resilience:** The ability to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to adverse conditions.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\nIt is the policy of the organization to maintain a robust operational risk management framework for its stablecoin infrastructure. This framework must proactively identify, assess, monitor, mitigate, and report on operational risks, with a paramount focus on cybersecurity and resilience. The organization commits to implementing security controls and continuity plans that meet or exceed industry best practices and applicable regulatory standards to ensure the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of stablecoin operations.\n\n## 5. Procedures\n### A. Governance & Accountability\n1.  The Board of Directors or equivalent governing body retains ultimate oversight of operational risk.\n2.  A designated Chief Risk Officer (CRO) or senior manager is responsible for implementing and enforcing this policy.\n3.  A cross-functional Operational Risk Committee shall meet quarterly to review risk assessments, incidents, and control effectiveness.\n\n### B. Risk Identification & Assessment\n1.  Conduct a bi-annual comprehensive risk assessment of all stablecoin infrastructure components using a standardized methodology (e.g., FAIR, OCTAVE).\n2.  Maintain a centralized Operational Risk Register documenting identified risks, their likelihood, impact, mitigation controls, and responsible owners.\n3.  Assessments must specifically address:\n    - **Technical Risks:** Node failures, consensus mechanism flaws, smart contract vulnerabilities, API failures.\n    - **Cybersecurity Risks:** Unauthorized access, DDoS attacks, malware, insider threats, key compromise.\n    - **Third-Party Risks:** Dependencies on cloud providers, blockchain networks, liquidity partners, and custodians.\n    - **Process Risks:** Errors in issuance/redemption, reconciliation failures, manual process failures.\n\n### C.

Enforce strict key generation, storage, rotation, and revocation procedures.\n3.  **Network Security:** Segment networks, employ firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests.\n4.  **Smart Contract Security:** For issued stablecoins, require formal code audits by at least two independent, reputable firms prior to deployment and after any major updates.\n5.  **Data Protection:** Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit. Maintain secure, immutable audit logs for all critical transactions and system changes.\n\n### D. Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery (BCP/DR)\n1.  Develop and maintain a formal BCP/DR Plan for stablecoin operations, reviewed and tested at least annually.\n2.  Define Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) for all critical systems.\n3.  Establish geographically dispersed backup systems or hot/cold standby nodes to ensure resilience.\n4.  Ensure secure, offline backups of critical data (e.g., cryptographic key shards, configuration) are maintained and regularly tested for restoration.\n\n### E. Incident Response\n1.  Establish a formal Security & Operational Incident Response Plan.\n2.  Define clear roles, communication protocols, and escalation paths for incident handling.\n3.  Conduct tabletop exercises simulating major incidents (e.g., reserve compromise, network halt) at least semi-annually.\n4.  All significant incidents must be documented, with root cause analysis performed and corrective actions implemented.\n\n### F. Third-Party Risk Management\n1.  Conduct due diligence on all critical third-party service providers (custodians, validators, cloud hosts).\n2.  Ensure contracts include right-to-audit clauses and define security and availability requirements.\n3.  Continuously monitor the financial and operational health of key partners.\n\n## 6.

The Risk Management function will conduct periodic internal audits to verify compliance.\n3.  Material non-compliance must be reported to the Operational Risk Committee and remediated within a defined timeframe.\n4.  Evidence of compliance (audit reports, test results, risk assessments) must be retained for a minimum of five years to satisfy regulatory examinations.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule\n- This policy shall be reviewed and updated **annually** by the CRO and the Operational Risk Committee.\n- Ad-hoc reviews and updates will be triggered by:\n    - Significant changes in the stablecoin infrastructure or business model.\n    - A major security incident.\n    - Changes in applicable laws or regulations.\n- All policy revisions require approval from the Board of Directors or designated committee.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements\nThis policy is designed to align with principles and requirements set forth in, but not limited to, the following frameworks and anticipated regulations:\n- **Bank for International Settlements (BIS) / Basel Committee:** Principles for the Sound Management of Operational Risk.\n- **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST):** Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and Special Publication 800-53 (Security Controls).\n- **International Organization for Standardization (ISO):** ISO 27001 (Information Security), ISO 22301 (Business Continuity).\n- **Financial Stability Board (FSB):** Recommendations for the Regulation, Supervision and Oversight of Global Stablecoin Arrangements.\n- **Relevant National Regulations:** (To be tailored: e.g., NYDFS Part 200 (Virtual Currency), EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), etc.).\n```"
