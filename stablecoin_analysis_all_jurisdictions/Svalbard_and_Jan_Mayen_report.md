# Gap Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently operates without any documented policies addressing fundamental regulatory requirements for stablecoin operations. This represents an extreme compliance risk with potential for immediate regulatory intervention, legal liability, and operational shutdown. The absence of AML/CTF, consumer protection, and securities compliance frameworks creates multiple critical vulnerabilities. Immediate action is required to develop comprehensive policies before continuing any stablecoin-related operations. Given the jurisdiction's likely reliance on international standards (EU frameworks, FATF recommendations), policies should be developed with reference to these standards while conducting specific regulatory research on Svalbard and Jan Mayen's implementation.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance and operation requires a specific regulatory framework including licensing, reserve requirements, redemption rights, and consumer protection measures

**Current Status:** No stablecoin-specific policies identified

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies governing stablecoin issuance, management, reserves, redemption, or consumer protections

**Impact:** Legal prohibition of stablecoin operations, regulatory enforcement actions, fines, license revocation, reputational damage, and potential criminal liability

**Recommendation:** Immediately suspend all stablecoin operations until comprehensive policies are developed. Establish a regulatory working group to research applicable frameworks (EU MiCA, FATF recommendations, national implementations) and draft policies covering issuance, reserve management, redemption mechanisms, disclosure requirements, and consumer protection.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Financial institutions must implement Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) programs including KYC, transaction monitoring, and reporting

**Current Status:** No AML/CTF policies identified

**Gap:** No policies for customer identification, due diligence, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, or recordkeeping

**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, loss of banking relationships, exclusion from financial systems, criminal prosecution for money laundering facilitation

**Recommendation:** Develop and implement a comprehensive AML/CTF program aligned with FATF recommendations and local implementation. Include customer identification procedures, risk-based due diligence, transaction monitoring systems, suspicious activity reporting protocols, and employee training programs.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Digital asset service providers must comply with securities regulations if tokens qualify as securities

**Recommendation:** Implement a token classification framework to determine regulatory status. Develop policies for securities registration, disclosure, and investor protection if tokens qualify as securities under applicable laws.

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Financial service providers must implement consumer protection measures including clear disclosures, fair practices, and dispute resolution

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive consumer protection policies including clear fee structures, risk disclosure statements, complaint handling procedures, dispute resolution mechanisms, and data privacy protections aligned with GDPR or equivalent standards.

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Financial institutions must maintain adequate capital and liquidity requirements

**Recommendation:** Establish capital adequacy policies based on risk-weighted assets. Implement liquidity management frameworks including reserve requirements, redemption stress testing, and contingency funding plans.
