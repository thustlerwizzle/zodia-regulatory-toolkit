## Executive Summary
The company currently has no documented policies addressing stablecoin regulation in Azerbaijan, representing a critical compliance failure. All regulatory requirements are currently unmet, creating significant legal, operational, and reputational risks. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive regulatory compliance framework before considering any stablecoin operations in Azerbaijan. The highest priority should be given to establishing legal authorization and AML/CTF compliance, as these represent the most severe regulatory risks. Given the limited regulatory research available, the company should immediately engage local legal counsel to conduct a thorough regulatory assessment specific to Azerbaijan's evolving digital asset framework.
