# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-11T21:11:59.083410

## Executive Summary
The company is in a state of total non-compliance with the foundational regulatory requirements for operating a stablecoin in Aruba. No policies exist to address core areas such as licensing, reserve backing, AML/CFT, or consumer protection. Operating in this state carries extreme legal, financial, and reputational risk. Immediate action is required to cease any operational activity and begin a comprehensive compliance program build-out, starting with securing legal advice and addressing the critical licensing and reserve management gaps.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance requires licensing/registration with Aruban financial authorities (Central Bank of Aruba/CBA).

**Current Status:** No policy exists for licensing or regulatory registration.

**Gap:** Complete absence of any framework or procedure for obtaining necessary licenses to issue or operate stablecoin services in Aruba.

**Impact:** Operating without a license is illegal, leading to immediate enforcement action, fines, seizure of operations, and criminal liability for directors.

**Recommendation:** Immediately halt any stablecoin-related operations. Engage legal counsel in Aruba to initiate the licensing application process with the CBA and develop a Licensing & Registration Policy.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must maintain 1:1 high-quality liquid asset (HQLA) reserves, segregated from company assets, with regular independent attestation/audit.

**Current Status:** No policy exists for reserve management, custody, or attestation.

**Gap:** No governance over the backing assets, creating risk of insolvency and commingling of funds. No process for independent verification exists.

**Impact:** Risk of a 'break-the-buck' event leading to loss of consumer funds, loss of trust, regulatory sanctions, and potential collapse of the stablecoin.

**Recommendation:** Develop a comprehensive Reserve Management & Custody Policy mandating 100% HQLA backing in segregated accounts. Establish contracts with qualified custodians and a schedule for monthly attestations and annual audits by a registered public accountant.

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Adherence to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) regulations, including KYC, CDD, transaction monitoring, and reporting to FIU Aruba.

**Current Status:** No AML/CFT policy exists.

**Gap:** Complete lack of procedures for customer identification, ongoing due diligence, suspicious activity monitoring, or regulatory reporting.

**Impact:** High risk of facilitating financial crime, leading to severe regulatory penalties, loss of banking relationships, and reputational destruction.

**Recommendation:** Develop and implement a full AML/CFT Program compliant with Aruba's National Ordinance on the Reporting of Unusual Transactions and FATF standards. Integrate a transaction monitoring system and appoint a dedicated AML Officer.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Clear, fair disclosure to users regarding terms of service, redemption rights, risks, and the nature of the reserve assets.

**Recommendation:** Create a Consumer Disclosure & Transparency Policy. Draft public terms of service and a stablecoin 'white paper' detailing the operational model, redemption process, and associated risks, approved by legal counsel.

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Implementation of robust cybersecurity and operational resilience measures to protect systems and customer data.

**Recommendation:** Develop an Information Security & Operational Resilience Policy based on a framework like NIST or ISO 27001. Implement strong access controls, cold wallet storage for reserves, and regular penetration testing.
