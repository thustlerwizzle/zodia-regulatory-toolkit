# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-06T03:44:37.663762

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE GAPS IDENTIFIED: The company currently has no policies addressing stablecoin regulation in Mongolia. All regulatory requirements are unmet, creating significant legal, operational, and reputational risks. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive regulatory compliance framework before engaging in stablecoin operations in Mongolia. Priority should be given to establishing legal classification, licensing strategy, and AML/CTF compliance as foundational requirements. Given the limited regulatory research results, additional Mongolia-specific legal consultation is urgently needed to validate requirements and ensure complete compliance.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Legal definition and classification of stablecoins as either currency, security, or payment instrument under Mongolian law

**Current Status:** No existing policy for stablecoin classification or regulatory treatment

**Gap:** Complete absence of policy framework for defining stablecoins and determining applicable regulatory regimes

**Impact:** Legal uncertainty, potential regulatory enforcement actions, inability to operate legally in Mongolia

**Recommendation:** Develop classification policy aligned with Bank of Mongolia and Financial Regulatory Commission guidance; establish legal review process for stablecoin offerings

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Licensing requirements for stablecoin issuers and service providers under Mongolian financial regulations

**Current Status:** No licensing framework or application procedures established

**Gap:** Missing policies for obtaining necessary financial licenses, registration requirements, and ongoing compliance monitoring

**Impact:** Operating without required licenses could result in fines, business suspension, or criminal liability

**Recommendation:** Create licensing policy outlining application requirements, documentation, and ongoing compliance obligations; establish relationship with Mongolian regulators

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Reserve requirements and asset backing for stablecoins to ensure 1:1 redemption capability

**Recommendation:** Implement reserve policy requiring 100% backing with high-quality liquid assets; establish independent auditing and regular reporting

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance under Mongolian law

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive AML/CTF policy including KYC procedures, transaction monitoring, and reporting protocols aligned with Mongolian FIU requirements

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including disclosure requirements, redemption rights, and complaint handling

**Recommendation:** Establish consumer protection policy with clear disclosures, redemption guarantees, complaint procedures, and user education
