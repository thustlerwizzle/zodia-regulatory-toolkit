# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-12T17:24:04.177276

## Executive Summary
The company currently has no documented policies addressing stablecoin regulatory requirements for Aland Islands operations. This represents a critical compliance gap that prevents lawful operation in this jurisdiction. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive regulatory compliance program before commencing any stablecoin-related activities. The highest priority gaps relate to licensing, reserve backing, and AML/CFT compliance, which are fundamental regulatory requirements in most jurisdictions including Aland Islands (which likely follows EU/financial regulatory standards).

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance requires licensing/authorization from relevant financial authority

**Current Status:** No documented policy for stablecoin issuance authorization

**Gap:** Company lacks policies and procedures for obtaining necessary regulatory approvals for stablecoin operations in Aland Islands

**Impact:** Potential for regulatory enforcement actions, fines, and prohibition of operations

**Recommendation:** Develop a regulatory licensing framework that includes: 1) Jurisdictional analysis for Aland Islands, 2) Application procedures for financial licenses, 3) Ongoing compliance monitoring for license maintenance

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Stablecoin reserves must be fully backed and subject to regular audits

**Current Status:** No reserve management or audit policies documented

**Impact:** Risk of insolvency, loss of customer funds, and regulatory sanctions for misrepresentation

**Recommendation:** Create comprehensive reserve management policy including: 1) 100% backing requirement, 2) Qualified custodian requirements, 3) Monthly attestations, 4) Quarterly independent audits, 5) Public disclosure protocols

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance including customer due diligence and transaction monitoring

**Recommendation:** Develop stablecoin-specific AML/CFT program including: 1) Risk assessment for Aland Islands, 2) Enhanced due diligence for large transactions, 3) Travel rule compliance, 4) Suspicious activity reporting procedures

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including disclosures and redemption rights

**Recommendation:** Implement consumer protection policy covering: 1) Clear terms of service, 2) Redemption procedures and timelines, 3) Fee transparency, 4) Complaint handling process, 5) Risk disclosures

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Cybersecurity and operational resilience requirements

**Recommendation:** Establish stablecoin cybersecurity framework including: 1) Multi-signature wallet controls, 2) Cold storage protocols, 3) Incident response plan, 4) Regular penetration testing, 5) Business continuity planning
