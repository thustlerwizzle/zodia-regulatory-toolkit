# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-12T17:54:17.645995

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company appears to have no documented policies addressing fundamental regulatory requirements for stablecoin operations in EU/Spanish jurisdiction (including Melilla). This represents an existential risk to the business, with immediate regulatory intervention likely if operations commence without remediation. All identified regulatory requirements are currently not met. Immediate action is required on licensing strategy, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance before any customer operations can be considered. The company should suspend any customer-facing activities until critical gaps are addressed and engage specialized legal and compliance expertise immediately.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must maintain 1:1 reserves in high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) with regular independent audits

**Current Status:** No documented policy on reserve management or audit requirements

**Gap:** Complete absence of reserve management framework, custody arrangements, or audit protocols

**Impact:** Regulatory enforcement action, license revocation, financial penalties, loss of customer trust, potential insolvency risk

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive reserve management policy specifying: 1) Eligible asset classes (cash, government securities, etc.), 2) Custody arrangements with regulated institutions, 3) Monthly attestations and quarterly independent audits, 4) Public disclosure of reserve composition

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance including customer due diligence (CDD), transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT program

**Gap:** Missing entire AML/CFT framework required for financial institutions operating in EU/Spanish jurisdiction

**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, criminal liability for executives, inability to access banking services, reputational damage

**Recommendation:** Implement full AML/CFT program including: 1) Risk-based customer identification and verification, 2) Ongoing transaction monitoring system, 3) Designated compliance officer, 4) Regular staff training, 5) Suspicious activity reporting procedures

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Licensing/registration with relevant authorities (potentially Bank of Spain/CNMV for Spanish territory including Melilla)

**Current Status:** No documented licensing strategy or regulatory engagement plan

**Gap:** Unclear regulatory status and lack of engagement with supervisory authorities

**Impact:** Operating illegally, immediate shutdown orders, criminal prosecution of executives, asset seizure

**Recommendation:** Immediately: 1) Determine applicable licensing regime (MiCA, Spanish payment services regulations), 2) Engage legal counsel specialized in Spanish/EU financial regulation, 3) Prepare licensing application, 4) Establish dialogue with Bank of Spain/CNMV

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including clear disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling

**Recommendation:** Create consumer protection framework with: 1) Clear risk disclosures in plain language, 2) Guaranteed redemption procedures with defined timelines, 3) Dedicated complaint handling process, 4) Compensation scheme or insurance arrangements

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity requirements for payment systems

**Recommendation:** Develop operational resilience framework including: 1) Business continuity and disaster recovery plans, 2) Cybersecurity controls aligned with NIST/ISO standards, 3) Incident response procedures, 4) Regular penetration testing and security audits

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Governance requirements including fit and proper assessments of management, board oversight, and risk management framework

**Recommendation:** Establish governance framework including: 1) Board composition with independent members, 2) Risk management committee, 3) Fit and proper assessments for directors/senior management, 4) Three lines of defense model

### Gap 4: GAP-007
**Requirement:** Data protection compliance (GDPR) for EU territories including Melilla

**Recommendation:** Implement GDPR compliance program including: 1) Data protection officer appointment, 2) Data processing agreements, 3) Privacy notices and consent mechanisms, 4) Data subject rights procedures, 5) Data breach notification protocols
