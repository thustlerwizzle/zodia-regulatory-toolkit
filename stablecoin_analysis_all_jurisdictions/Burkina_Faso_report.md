# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T19:48:34.595648

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits a complete absence of policies addressing stablecoin regulation in Burkina Faso, representing critical compliance failure across all regulatory domains. Immediate action is required to establish basic compliance frameworks, with particular urgency around legal authorization, AML/CTF, and consumer protection requirements. The company cannot legally operate in Burkina Faso's jurisdiction without addressing these fundamental gaps. Priority should be given to engaging local legal counsel and regulatory experts to navigate the complex WAEMU regulatory environment while building internal compliance capabilities.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Legal framework for stablecoin issuance and operation in Burkina Faso

**Current Status:** No documented policy exists

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing stablecoin operations in Burkina Faso's regulatory environment

**Impact:** Legal exposure, potential regulatory sanctions, inability to operate legally in Burkina Faso

**Recommendation:** Immediately establish a legal framework analysis team to research and document Burkina Faso's financial regulations, with specific focus on digital assets and payment systems

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Licensing requirements for digital asset service providers

**Current Status:** No licensing or authorization policies

**Gap:** No procedures for obtaining necessary licenses or authorizations from Burkina Faso regulatory authorities

**Impact:** Illegal operations, potential criminal liability, asset seizure, and business closure

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CTF policies

**Gap:** Missing AML/CTF framework required for financial service providers in West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) region

**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, reputational damage, potential criminal prosecution, and exclusion from financial systems

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive AML/CTF program including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and staff training aligned with WAEMU directives

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements

**Recommendation:** Develop consumer protection framework including clear risk disclosures, terms of service, complaint procedures, and data protection measures

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Reserve management and transparency for stablecoin issuers

**Recommendation:** Establish reserve management policy with clear custody arrangements, regular independent audits, and public reporting requirements

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive operational risk management framework including cybersecurity protocols, incident response plans, and business continuity procedures
