# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-05T23:54:19.740562

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits a complete lack of policies addressing fundamental regulatory requirements for stablecoin issuance and operation in Lebanon. Based on standard regulatory expectations for stablecoins globally and Lebanon's likely alignment with international standards, compliance status is 'not_met' across all critical domains. The company is operating with extreme regulatory risk. Immediate action is required to: 1) Determine legal permissibility of operations, 2) Develop core policies for reserves, AML, and consumer protection before any further activity, and 3) Engage with Lebanese regulators (primarily Banque du Liban) to understand specific local requirements. The current state suggests the company may not be legally operational and is exposed to severe enforcement risks.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Legal authorization to issue stablecoins in Lebanon (likely requiring approval from Banque du Liban - BDL)

**Current Status:** No documented policy found regarding stablecoin issuance authorization

**Gap:** Complete absence of policy addressing the fundamental regulatory requirement for authorization to operate as a stablecoin issuer in Lebanon

**Impact:** Potential for immediate regulatory enforcement action, including cease-and-desist orders, fines, and criminal liability for operating without proper authorization

**Recommendation:** 1. Immediately suspend any stablecoin issuance activities until regulatory clarity is obtained. 2. Engage Lebanese legal counsel to determine specific authorization requirements from BDL. 3. Develop an Authorization Framework Policy outlining the process for obtaining and maintaining necessary licenses.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Reserve requirements and backing asset management (likely requiring full backing with high-quality liquid assets)

**Current Status:** No documented policy on reserve management, asset composition, or custody arrangements

**Gap:** No policies governing the composition, custody, audit, or transparency of reserve assets backing stablecoins

**Impact:** Risk of insolvency, loss of consumer funds, regulatory sanctions for misrepresentation, and loss of market confidence leading to potential stablecoin de-pegging

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop a Comprehensive Reserve Management Policy specifying: asset types permitted (e.g., cash, government securities), minimum liquidity ratios, custody requirements with qualified custodians, and independent audit frequency. 2. Implement real-time reserve reporting mechanisms. 3. Establish segregation of client funds from corporate assets.

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance specific to virtual assets (likely aligned with FATF recommendations)

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CTF policy specific to stablecoin operations

**Gap:** Lack of risk-based AML/CTF program addressing stablecoin-specific risks including wallet screening, transaction monitoring for mixing/tumbling, and enhanced due diligence for high-risk jurisdictions

**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties, potential designation as a money laundering concern, loss of banking relationships, and reputational damage

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop a Virtual Asset AML/CTF Policy incorporating: customer identification and verification (KYC) for all wallet holders, transaction monitoring systems, suspicious activity reporting procedures, and sanctions screening. 2. Appoint a dedicated Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO). 3. Implement blockchain analytics tools for transaction monitoring.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including redemption rights, disclosures, and complaint handling

**Recommendation:** 1. Create a Consumer Protection Policy that guarantees timely redemption at par value. 2. Develop clear, plain-language disclosures covering all risks and fees. 3. Establish a formal complaints handling procedure with defined resolution timelines. 4. Implement a user education program on stablecoin risks.

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity standards for digital asset platforms

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop a Digital Asset Cybersecurity Policy covering: secure key generation and storage (preferably using HSMs), smart contract audit requirements before deployment, penetration testing schedule, and incident response plan. 2. Implement multi-signature schemes for treasury transactions. 3. Establish a bug bounty program.

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Regular reporting and audit requirements to regulatory authorities

**Recommendation:** 1. Create a Regulatory Reporting Policy detailing report types, frequencies, responsible parties, and review procedures. 2. Establish a relationship with an audit firm experienced in digital assets. 3. Develop internal controls for data collection and report preparation.
