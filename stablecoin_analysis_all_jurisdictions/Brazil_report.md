# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T19:30:08.472652

## Executive Summary
The company currently has no documented policies addressing Brazilian stablecoin regulations, representing a critical compliance gap. All major regulatory requirements are unmet, exposing the company to significant legal, financial, and reputational risks. Immediate action is required to develop Brazil-specific policies, with priority on BCB registration, AML compliance, and consumer protection. The company should not operate in Brazil until at least the critical gaps are addressed and appropriate regulatory approvals are obtained.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Registration with Brazilian Central Bank (BCB) for stablecoin issuers and payment institutions

**Current Status:** No documented policy for BCB registration requirements

**Gap:** Company lacks policies addressing mandatory registration with BCB for stablecoin operations in Brazil

**Impact:** Legal prohibition from operating in Brazil, potential fines, and criminal liability for executives

**Recommendation:** Develop BCB registration policy including: 1) Registration categories assessment (payment institution vs. fintech), 2) Application requirements documentation, 3) Ongoing reporting obligations

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance under BCB Resolution 4,893 and Law 9,613/1998

**Current Status:** No Brazil-specific AML policy documented

**Gap:** Missing Brazil-specific AML/CFT policies addressing local regulatory requirements including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting to COAF

**Impact:** Severe regulatory sanctions, business suspension, reputational damage, and potential criminal charges

**Recommendation:** Create Brazil AML policy incorporating: 1) Enhanced due diligence for Brazilian customers, 2) Transaction monitoring thresholds aligned with BCB requirements, 3) COAF reporting procedures, 4) Local compliance officer designation

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Reserve requirements and asset backing for stablecoins (similar to BCB Circular 4,015 for payment institutions)

**Recommendation:** Establish reserve management policy covering: 1) Eligible assets for backing, 2) Segregation requirements, 3) Liquidity ratios, 4) Independent audit procedures, 5) Monthly reporting to BCB

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection under Brazilian Consumer Defense Code (Law 8,078/1990)

**Recommendation:** Develop consumer protection policy including: 1) Portuguese-language disclosures, 2) Complaint handling procedures, 3) Refund and cancellation rights, 4) Data protection aligned with LGPD

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Data protection compliance with LGPD (Brazilian General Data Protection Law)

**Recommendation:** Create LGPD compliance policy covering: 1) Data processing legal bases, 2) Data subject rights procedures, 3) International data transfer mechanisms, 4) DPO appointment and responsibilities, 5) Data breach notification procedures
