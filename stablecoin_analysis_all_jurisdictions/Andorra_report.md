## Executive Summary
Overall compliance status is NON-COMPLIANT. The company currently has no documented policies addressing the core regulatory requirements for operating a stablecoin service in Andorra. This represents an extreme level of regulatory risk. Operating in this state would be unlawful. Immediate and foundational work is required to: 1) Understand the precise regulatory landscape through expert legal counsel, 2) Develop a complete suite of policies and controls before commencing any regulated activity, and 3) Engage proactively with the Andorran Financial Authority (AFA) to seek necessary authorization. All identified gaps are at least Medium priority, with several being Critical due to the legal prohibition of unlicensed financial services.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Legal authorization and licensing for stablecoin issuance and operation in Andorra

**Current Status:** No documented policy exists

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing Andorran regulatory requirements for stablecoin operations. Andorra requires specific authorization from the Andorran Financial Authority (AFA) for financial activities, including digital asset services.

**Impact:** Legal prohibition of operations, regulatory enforcement actions, fines, and potential criminal liability for operating without proper authorization.

**Recommendation:** Immediately suspend any stablecoin operations in Andorra until proper licensing is obtained. Develop a comprehensive licensing strategy and engage with the AFA to understand specific requirements.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance under Andorran Law 14/2017 and AFA regulations

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CTF policy for Andorran operations

**Gap:** No policies address Andorra's specific AML/CTF requirements, including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, reporting obligations to the UIFAND (Financial Intelligence Unit), and record-keeping mandates.

**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, loss of license, reputational damage, and potential criminal prosecution for AML/CTF violations.

**Recommendation:** Develop and implement an Andorra-specific AML/CTF program that aligns with Law 14/2017. Appoint a local compliance officer, establish customer identification procedures, and implement transaction monitoring systems.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Capital and reserve requirements for stablecoin issuers

**Recommendation:** Conduct research to determine exact capital and reserve requirements. Develop a treasury management policy that ensures full backing of issued stablecoins and meets regulatory capital thresholds.

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection, disclosure, and transparency obligations

**Recommendation:** Draft comprehensive terms of service, risk disclosures, and a transparency framework. Commit to publishing regular attestation reports or proof of reserves from a qualified third-party auditor.

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity standards

**Recommendation:** Implement a robust IT governance framework based on standards like ISO 27001. Develop incident response and business continuity plans specific to stablecoin operations.
