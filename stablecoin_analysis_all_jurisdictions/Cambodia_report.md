# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T20:06:07.624800

## Executive Summary
Overall compliance status is severely deficient. The company lacks any foundational policies required to operate a stablecoin or similar payment/financial service in Cambodia legally and safely. The regulatory environment for stablecoins in Cambodia is nascent but governed by existing broad financial laws. All identified gaps are at least 'High' priority, with the absence of licensing and AML/CFT frameworks being 'Critical'. Immediate action is required to develop a full suite of policies and engage with Cambodian regulators before any operational activity commences. The company is currently non-compliant and exposed to extreme legal, financial, and reputational risks.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Legal authorization/licensing for stablecoin issuance or operation in Cambodia

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** Company lacks any policy addressing the fundamental requirement for legal authorization to operate stablecoin services in Cambodia. The National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) has not issued a specific regulatory framework for stablecoins, but general financial and payment system laws apply. Operating without clarity on authorization constitutes a significant legal risk.

**Impact:** Risk of regulatory enforcement action, including cease-and-desist orders, fines, and reputational damage. Potential criminal liability for operating an unauthorized payment service.

**Recommendation:** 1. Immediately engage legal counsel in Cambodia to interpret the applicability of the Law on Banking and Financial Institutions, the Law on Payment Services, and NBC regulations to the proposed stablecoin activity. 2. Develop a policy that mandates obtaining formal regulatory approval or a license before any operational launch. 3. Establish a procedure for ongoing regulatory dialogue with the NBC.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Adherence to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (CFT) regulations as per Cambodia's AML/CFT Law and NBC guidelines.

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT policy found

**Gap:** Company has no policy to implement mandatory Customer Due Diligence (CDD), Know Your Customer (KYC), transaction monitoring, or suspicious activity reporting required for financial/payment service providers in Cambodia.

**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, loss of ability to transact with correspondent banks, heightened risk of facilitating financial crime, and potential designation as a high-risk entity by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop a comprehensive AML/CFT policy aligned with Cambodian law and FATF standards. 2. Implement a risk-based KYC/CDD program. 3. Deploy transaction monitoring and sanctions screening systems. 4. Designate a Compliance Officer and establish a process for reporting to Cambodia's Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU).

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Maintenance of adequate reserves for asset-backed stablecoins (if applicable) and related disclosure/audit requirements.

**Recommendation:** 1. Draft a Reserve Management Policy specifying 1:1 backing, permissible asset types, and custody arrangements with qualified custodians. 2. Establish a policy for monthly/quarterly attestations by independent auditors and public disclosure of reserve composition.

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures, including clear terms of service, redemption rights, and risk disclosures.

**Recommendation:** 1. Create comprehensive Terms of Service and a Privacy Policy compliant with Cambodian law. 2. Develop clear user-facing documentation on redemption processes, fees, and risks. 3. Establish a formal customer complaint resolution procedure.

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Cybersecurity and operational resilience requirements for payment systems.

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop an Information Security Policy and a Data Protection Policy. 2. Implement a formal Incident Response Plan and Business Continuity Plan. 3. Conduct regular penetration testing and security audits.
