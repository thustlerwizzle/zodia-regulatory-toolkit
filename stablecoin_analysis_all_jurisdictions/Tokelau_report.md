# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-12T13:20:29.241346

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits a complete absence of documented policies necessary for stablecoin regulation compliance. All fundamental regulatory requirements are unmet, representing critical compliance deficiencies. Immediate action is required to establish basic policy frameworks before any stablecoin operations commence. Priority should be given to licensing strategy, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance, as these represent the most severe regulatory risks. Given the limited specific regulatory information available for Tokelau, the company should conduct thorough jurisdictional research while implementing internationally recognized standards for stablecoin regulation.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance requires licensing/registration with financial authorities (standard requirement in most jurisdictions)

**Current Status:** No documented policy on stablecoin issuance licensing

**Gap:** Company lacks policies addressing licensing requirements for issuing stablecoins in Tokelau or other jurisdictions

**Impact:** Potential for operating without required licenses leading to regulatory enforcement, fines, and business shutdown

**Recommendation:** Conduct jurisdictional analysis to determine licensing requirements in Tokelau and target markets. Develop licensing strategy and policy framework.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Stablecoin reserves must be held in secure, segregated accounts with regular attestations/audits

**Current Status:** No documented reserve management policy

**Gap:** Missing policies governing reserve composition, custody, segregation, and verification

**Impact:** Risk of insufficient backing for stablecoins leading to loss of peg, consumer harm, and regulatory action

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive reserve management policy including: 1) Acceptable reserve assets, 2) Custody arrangements, 3) Segregation requirements, 4) Audit/attestation frequency

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance including KYC, transaction monitoring, and reporting obligations

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT policy

**Gap:** Complete absence of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing framework

**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, loss of banking relationships, and potential criminal liability

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive AML/CFT program including: 1) Risk assessment, 2) Customer due diligence procedures, 3) Transaction monitoring, 4) Suspicious activity reporting, 5) Employee training

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling

**Recommendation:** Develop consumer protection policy covering: 1) Clear redemption mechanisms, 2) Fee transparency, 3) Risk disclosures, 4) Complaint resolution procedures

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity requirements

**Recommendation:** Establish operational resilience framework including: 1) Cybersecurity standards, 2) Business continuity planning, 3) Incident response procedures, 4) Third-party risk management

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Governance and risk management framework

**Recommendation:** Implement three lines of defense model: 1) Business unit controls, 2) Risk/compliance oversight, 3) Internal audit. Establish risk appetite statement and regular reporting to board.
