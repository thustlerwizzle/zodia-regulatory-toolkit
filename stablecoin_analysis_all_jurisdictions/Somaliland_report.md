# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-12T18:32:37.601098

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no documented policies addressing stablecoin operations in Somaliland. This represents a complete regulatory compliance failure across all essential domains. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive compliance framework before any operations commence. The absence of policies creates severe legal, operational, and reputational risks. Priority should be given to understanding Somaliland's specific regulatory requirements (if any exist) and developing corresponding policies, with particular emphasis on licensing, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance. Given the limited regulatory research results, the company must invest in proper legal and regulatory due diligence specific to Somaliland's jurisdiction.
