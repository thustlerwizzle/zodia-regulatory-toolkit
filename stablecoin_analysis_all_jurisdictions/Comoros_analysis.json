Purpose and Scope\n### Purpose\nThis policy establishes a comprehensive framework for the management of reserves backing issued stablecoins, ensures the segregation and protection of customer funds, and defines procedures for audits, redemptions, and liquidity management. Its primary objective is to ensure that all issued stablecoins are fully backed by high-quality, liquid assets at all times, thereby maintaining stability, trust, and regulatory compliance.\n\n### Scope\nThis policy applies to all business units, personnel, and third-party service providers involved in the issuance, management, custody, or redemption of stablecoins by [Company Name]. It covers all stablecoin products offered by the organization, regardless of the underlying blockchain or technology.\n\n## 3. Definitions\n*   **Stablecoin:** A digital asset issued by [Company Name] designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified fiat currency (e.g., USD, EUR).\n*   **Reserve Assets:** The collective pool of assets held to back the total circulating supply of a stablecoin at a 1:1 or greater ratio.\n*   **Custodian:** A regulated, qualified financial institution responsible for the safekeeping of Reserve Assets.\n*   **Segregated Account:** A dedicated bank or custody account holding Reserve Assets that is legally separate from the company's operational funds and cannot be used to satisfy claims of the company's general creditors.\n*   **Authorized Participant:** A vetted institutional entity authorized to create (mint) and redeem stablecoins directly with the reserve.\n*   **Redemption:** The process by which a stablecoin holder exchanges their stablecoins for the underlying fiat currency or equivalent value from the Reserve Assets.\n*   **Liquidity Management:** The strategies and actions taken to ensure sufficient liquid assets are available to meet potential redemption demands under normal and stressed conditions.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\n[Company Name] is committed to operating with the highest standards of transparency, security, and financial integrity. It is our policy that:\n*   Every unit of stablecoin in circulation will be backed 1:1 by corresponding Reserve Assets held in Segregated Accounts.\n*   Reserve Assets will be limited to high-quality, liquid instruments as defined in the Procedures section.\n*   Customer funds (Reserve Assets) will be legally and operationally segregated from the company's corporate funds.\n*   The composition and value of the Reserve Assets will be subject to regular, independent third-party attestations and audits.\n*   Clear and reliable redemption procedures will be maintained to ensure stablecoin holders can redeem their tokens at par value.\n\n## 5.

Third-Party Audits and Attestations\n*   **Monthly Attestation:** A registered public accounting firm will perform a monthly review and issue an attestation report (e.g., SOC 2, agreed-upon procedures) confirming the reserve balance meets or exceeds the circulating stablecoin supply.\n*   **Annual Full Audit:** A comprehensive annual financial audit of the Reserve Assets will be conducted in accordance with relevant auditing standards.\n*   **Public Disclosure:** A summary of the most recent attestation report, including the total value of reserves and the breakdown of asset types, will be published on the company's website within 10 business days of receipt.\n\n### 5.4. Redemption Procedures and Liquidity Management\n*   **Redemption Process:** A clear, publicly documented process for redemptions will be maintained, detailing steps for both retail holders (via licensed partners) and Authorized Participants.\n*   **Liquidity Buffer:** A portion of reserves (minimum 10%) will be maintained in ultra-liquid assets (cash and overnight repos) to cover expected near-term redemption requests.\n*   **Stress Testing:** The Treasury and Risk teams will conduct quarterly stress tests simulating scenarios of elevated redemption demand to ensure the sufficiency of the liquidity buffer and the overall resilience of the reserve structure.\n*   **Contingency Plan:** A documented Liquidity Contingency Plan will outline actions to be taken in a crisis, including the orderly liquidation of longer-dated assets and communication protocols.\n\n## 6.

Ad-hoc reviews will be triggered by significant changes in regulatory requirements, product offerings, or market conditions. All revisions require approval from the CFO and CCO.\n\n## 8.
