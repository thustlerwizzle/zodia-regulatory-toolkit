# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T22:52:24.843086

## Executive Summary
The company currently has no documented policies addressing stablecoin regulatory requirements under Finnish/EU regulations. This represents a critical compliance gap that would prevent legal operation as a stablecoin issuer in Finland and the broader EU market. All regulatory requirements are currently unmet, with the most critical gaps being authorization/licensing, reserve requirements, and AML/CFT compliance. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive policy framework aligned with MiCA and Finnish financial regulations before any stablecoin operations can commence. The company should prioritize engaging legal and compliance expertise familiar with EU crypto-asset regulations to develop the necessary policy infrastructure.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Authorization/Licensing for stablecoin issuance under EU MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation) - Finland, as an EU member state, must implement MiCA requirements for stablecoin issuers including authorization, capital requirements, governance, and consumer protection.

**Current Status:** No documented policy for stablecoin issuance authorization or licensing requirements

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing the regulatory authorization framework for issuing stablecoins in Finland/EU

**Impact:** Legal prohibition from issuing stablecoins in EU markets, potential regulatory enforcement actions, fines, and reputational damage

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive licensing and authorization policy framework aligned with MiCA requirements, including application procedures, capital adequacy requirements, and governance standards

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Reserve asset requirements for stablecoins - MiCA mandates specific reserve requirements including high-quality liquid assets, segregation of reserves, and regular independent audits

**Current Status:** No documented reserve management or asset backing policies

**Gap:** Missing policies for reserve composition, custody, segregation, and audit requirements for stablecoin backing assets

**Impact:** Inability to legally issue stablecoins, potential consumer harm if reserves are inadequate, regulatory sanctions

**Recommendation:** Establish reserve management policy specifying: 1) Eligible asset types and concentration limits, 2) Custody and segregation requirements, 3) Liquidity management, 4) Independent audit procedures

### Gap 3: GAP-004
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance - Finland's Money Laundering Act and EU AML directives require robust anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls for crypto-asset service providers

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT policies specific to stablecoin operations

**Gap:** Missing AML/CFT framework tailored to stablecoin transactions, customer due diligence, and suspicious activity monitoring

**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, potential criminal liability, loss of banking relationships

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive AML/CFT policy including: 1) Risk-based customer due diligence, 2) Transaction monitoring for stablecoin flows, 3) Suspicious activity reporting procedures, 4) Record-keeping requirements

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements - MiCA requires clear, fair, and not misleading information to consumers including redemption rights, risks, and fees

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive consumer protection policy including: 1) Standardized disclosure documents, 2) Redemption procedures and timelines, 3) Risk communication framework, 4) Complaint handling process

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Governance and risk management - MiCA requires sound governance arrangements, risk management frameworks, and internal controls for stablecoin issuers

**Recommendation:** Establish governance framework including: 1) Board oversight responsibilities, 2) Risk management policy covering operational, market, and liquidity risks, 3) Internal control procedures, 4) Business continuity planning

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity - EU DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act) and Finnish financial regulations require robust IT security and operational resilience measures

**Recommendation:** Develop operational resilience policy covering: 1) Cybersecurity controls and testing, 2) Incident response procedures, 3) Business continuity planning, 4) Third-party service provider management
