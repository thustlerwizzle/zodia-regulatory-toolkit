This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Lithuania\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-02-06T00:16:58.648568\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company exhibits a critical compliance gap with zero established policies addressing Lithuanian stablecoin regulatory requirements. All essential regulatory domains show 'not met' status, indicating complete non-compliance with financial market regulations. Immediate action is required to develop comprehensive policies across all regulatory areas, with priority given to licensing, AML/CTF, and reserve management requirements. The current state poses severe legal, operational, and reputational risks that could result in regulatory enforcement actions, including potential prohibition of operations in Lithuania.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Authorization/Licensing for stablecoin issuance and related services under Lithuanian financial market regulations (Bank of Lithuania oversight)\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found regarding licensing requirements for stablecoin operations\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing the need for proper authorization from the Bank of Lithuania to issue, manage, or facilitate stablecoin transactions\n\n**Impact:** Potential for regulatory enforcement actions, fines, license revocation, and criminal liability for operating without proper authorization\n\n**Recommendation:** Immediately establish a licensing framework policy that identifies required authorizations, application procedures, and ongoing compliance obligations with the Bank of Lithuania\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance for virtual asset service providers (VASP registration with FCIS)\n\n**Current Status:** No AML/CTF policy specific to stablecoin operations identified\n\n**Gap:** Missing comprehensive AML/CTF program addressing customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and VASP registration requirements\n\n**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties, reputational damage, potential criminal liability, and inability to operate legally in Lithuania\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop and implement a comprehensive AML/CTF policy aligned with Lithuanian Law on Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing, including FCIS registration procedures\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Reserve requirements and asset backing for stablecoin issuers (must maintain 1:1 backing with high-quality liquid assets)\n\n**Current Status:** No reserve management or asset backing policies documented\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policies governing reserve composition, custody, auditing, and
