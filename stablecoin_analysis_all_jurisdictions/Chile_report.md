# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T20:36:06.667196

## Executive Summary
The company currently exhibits a complete lack of documented policies addressing Chilean regulatory requirements for stablecoin operations. All critical regulatory areas show 'not met' status, indicating severe compliance deficiencies. The most critical gaps involve licensing, AML/CFT, and reserve management—areas that could result in immediate regulatory action. The company must prioritize developing a comprehensive compliance framework, beginning with regulatory analysis and policy development for critical areas. Given the absence of current policies, the company should consider suspending Chilean operations until basic compliance controls are established to mitigate substantial legal, financial, and reputational risks.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Registration/Licensing: Chilean financial regulators (CMF, SBIF) require stablecoin issuers and certain intermediaries to obtain authorization or register their operations.

**Current Status:** No documented policy for regulatory registration or licensing.

**Gap:** Complete absence of procedures for identifying registration requirements, application processes, or maintaining licenses.

**Impact:** Operating without required authorization could result in enforcement actions, fines, business suspension, and reputational damage.

**Recommendation:** 1. Conduct immediate regulatory mapping to identify specific licensing requirements. 2. Develop a licensing and registration policy with clear roles and procedures. 3. Establish a regulatory change management process.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML): Compliance with Chile's AML Law 19.913 and Financial Analysis Unit (UAF) requirements, including customer due diligence (CDD), transaction monitoring, and reporting.

**Current Status:** No AML/CFT policy documented.

**Gap:** Missing comprehensive AML program including KYC procedures, suspicious activity reporting, and employee training.

**Impact:** Significant legal and financial penalties, loss of banking relationships, and potential criminal liability for violations.

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop a risk-based AML/CFT program aligned with Chilean UAF standards. 2. Implement KYC/CDD procedures for all customers. 3. Establish transaction monitoring and reporting systems.

### Gap 3: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Reserve Management: Requirements for adequate backing of stablecoins with high-quality liquid assets, segregated accounts, and regular attestations/audits.

**Current Status:** No reserve management policy documented.

**Gap:** No framework for asset backing, custody arrangements, segregation of funds, or independent verification.

**Impact:** Insolvency risk, loss of peg stability, regulatory intervention, and systemic risk to users.

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop a reserve management policy specifying eligible assets and custody requirements. 2. Implement regular third-party attestations/audits. 3. Establish transparent reporting on reserve composition.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Consumer Protection: Requirements for clear disclosures, transparency about stablecoin operations, redemption rights, and risk warnings to consumers.

**Recommendation:** 1. Create comprehensive disclosure documents in Spanish. 2. Establish clear redemption and complaint resolution procedures. 3. Implement fair marketing and advertising guidelines.

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational Risk & Cybersecurity: Requirements for robust IT systems, cybersecurity measures, business continuity planning, and incident response.

**Recommendation:** 1. Implement comprehensive cybersecurity framework. 2. Develop incident response and business continuity plans. 3. Establish regular security testing and audits.

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Tax Compliance: Obligations for VAT, income tax, and reporting under Chilean tax authority (SII) requirements.

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop tax compliance policy addressing Chilean tax obligations. 2. Implement systems for proper tax calculation and reporting. 3. Establish relationship with local tax advisors.
