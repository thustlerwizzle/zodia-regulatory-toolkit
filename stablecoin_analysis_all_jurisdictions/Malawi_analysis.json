This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Malawi\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-02-06T00:36:07.163512\n\n## Executive Summary\nCRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company appears to have no documented policies for stablecoin operations in Malawi, representing a complete regulatory vacuum. All fundamental regulatory requirements for financial services and digital assets are unmet. Immediate action is required to: 1) Determine legal permissibility of operations, 2) Suspend activities until compliant frameworks are established, 3) Engage local regulatory experts to navigate Malawi's evolving digital asset landscape. The absence of basic AML, consumer protection, and reserve management policies creates existential business risks and potential legal liabilities.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Legal framework for stablecoin issuance and operation. Most jurisdictions require stablecoin issuers to be licensed financial institutions, maintain 1:1 reserves, and submit to regular audits.\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policies found for stablecoin operations in Malawi.\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing stablecoin issuance, reserve management, redemption rights, or operational requirements in Malawi.\n\n**Impact:** Operating without proper authorization could result in regulatory enforcement, fines, business shutdown, and criminal liability for company executives.\n\n**Recommendation:** Immediately suspend any stablecoin operations in Malawi until proper regulatory analysis is completed. Engage local legal counsel to determine if Malawi has specific regulations or if general financial services laws apply.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance. Financial regulators typically require KYC, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting.\n\n**Current Status:** No documented AML/CTF policies specific to stablecoin operations.\n\n**Gap:** Lack of customer identification procedures, transaction monitoring systems, or reporting mechanisms for suspicious activities involving stablecoins.\n\n**Impact:** Significant financial crime risks, potential regulatory penalties, reputational damage, and possible criminal prosecution for facilitating illicit finance.\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive AML/CTF framework including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and reporting procedures aligned with Financial Intelligence Authority (FIA) Malawi requirements.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Reserve management and custody requirements. Regulators typically mandate segregation of reserves, regular attestations, and secure custody arrangements.\n\n**Current Status:** No reserve management or custody policies documented.\n\n**Gap:** No policies governing how stablecoin reserves are held, managed, audited, or protected against loss.\n\n**Impact:** Risk of reserve shortfalls, loss of customer funds, regulatory intervention, and collapse of stablecoin peg leading to systemic failure.\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish robust reserve management policy requiring 100% backing, regular third-party audits, segregated accounts, and transparent reporting of reserve composition.\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including clear disclosures, redemption guarantees, and complaint resolution mechanisms.\n\n**Recommendation:** Create consumer protection framework with clear terms of service, redemption procedures, fee schedules, and complaint handling processes compliant with Malawi Consumer Protection Act.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Cybersecurity and operational resilience standards for digital asset services.\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive cybersecurity framework including secure key management, multi-signature controls, penetration testing, and incident response planning.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-007\n**Requirement:** Cross-border transaction compliance including foreign exchange controls and international sanctions.\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement cross-border transaction monitoring, sanctions screening, and reporting procedures aligned with Reserve Bank of Malawi requirements.\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **legal_authorization_framework**: not_met\n❌ **aml_ctf_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **consumer_protection**: not_met\n❌ **reserve_management**: not_met\n❌ **cybersecurity_standards**: not_met\n❌ **tax_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **cross_border_compliance**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update Summary\nGenerated: 2026-02-06T00:36:47.566309\n\n## Overview\nThis document summarizes proposed updates to company policies and standards based on regulatory gap analysis.\n\n## New Policies Required\n\n## Modified Policies\n\n### GAP-001\n**Category:** Legal\n**Current Policy:** No documented policies found for stablecoin operations in Malawi.\n**Proposed Change:** Immediately suspend any stablecoin operations in Malawi until proper regulatory analysis is completed.
