Purpose and Scope\n### 2.1 Purpose\nThis policy establishes a comprehensive framework to ensure the institution maintains adequate capital resources to cover current and future risks, in compliance with applicable EU regulations including EMD2, PSD2, and the forthcoming Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA). The policy aims to safeguard the institution's financial stability, protect customer funds, and ensure ongoing operational resilience.\n\n### 2.2 Scope\nThis policy applies to all business activities, departments, and subsidiaries under the institution's control that are subject to EU financial services regulations. It covers all capital planning, risk assessment, and prudential management activities undertaken by the institution.\n\n## 3. Definitions\n- **Capital Adequacy**: The sufficient availability of capital resources to absorb potential losses and support ongoing operations.\n- **Prudential Safeguards**: Measures implemented to ensure the soundness and stability of the institution.\n- **Eligible Capital**: Capital that meets regulatory criteria for loss-absorbency, as defined in applicable regulations.\n- **Capital Conservation Buffer**: An additional layer of capital held above the minimum regulatory requirement to absorb losses during periods of stress.\n- **Stress Testing**: A forward-looking exercise to assess the impact of severe but plausible adverse scenarios on the institution's capital position.\n- **Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP)**: The institution's internal process for assessing and maintaining adequate capital.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\nThe institution is committed to maintaining a strong capital base at all times to support its risk profile, strategic objectives, and regulatory obligations. Capital management shall be conducted prudently, ensuring that capital resources are sufficient to cover current and prospective risks. The Board of Directors bears ultimate responsibility for capital adequacy, while day-to-day management is delegated to the Risk Committee and Chief Financial Officer.\n\n## 5.

Purpose and Scope\n### 2.1 Purpose\nThe purpose of this policy is to establish a robust framework for the safeguarding of customer funds in compliance with Article 7 of Directive 2009/110/EC (EMD2) and Directive (EU) 2015/2366 (PSD2). This policy ensures that customer funds are protected from the institution’s own creditors, are not used for the institution’s own account, and are available for repayment in the event of insolvency.\n\n### 2.2 Scope\nThis policy applies to all customer funds received by [Institution Name] in connection with the issuance of electronic money and/or the provision of payment services. It is binding on all employees, contractors, and third-party service providers involved in the handling, reconciliation, or management of customer funds.\n\n## 3.

The Finance Department shall perform a daily reconciliation no later than 10:00 AM for the previous business day.\n2.  The reconciliation must compare the total balance of all Segregated Accounts (as confirmed by bank statements) against the total customer liability calculated from the internal ledger.\n3.  Any discrepancy must be investigated immediately by the Designated Officer. Material discrepancies (exceeding [e.g., 0.1%] of total customer funds) must be reported to the Compliance Officer and the Board within 24 hours.\n4.  A reconciliation log must be maintained, signed off daily by the responsible finance staff and reviewed weekly by the Designated Officer.\n\n### 5.3 Insolvency Protection Mechanisms\n1.

The institution shall maintain up-to-date records mapping customer liabilities to the specific Segregated Accounts holding the corresponding funds.\n3.  These records shall be stored securely and be readily accessible to an insolvency practitioner or competent authority.\n4.  The Designated Officer shall review the creditworthiness of the credit institutions holding Segregated Accounts quarterly to mitigate institutional risk.\n\n### 5.4 Management & Oversight\n1.  The Designated Officer has operational responsibility for this policy.\n2.  The Board of Directors retains ultimate responsibility for the safeguarding framework and will receive a quarterly report on its effectiveness from the Designated Officer and Compliance Officer.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n*   All personnel must adhere strictly to the procedures outlined in Section 5.\n*   Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.\n*   The Compliance Officer is responsible for monitoring adherence to this policy and reporting any breaches to the Board.\n*   The institution must be able to demonstrate full compliance with this policy to its auditors and competent supervisory authorities (e.g., [National Competent Authority Name]) upon request.\n\n## 7.

The institution shall maintain up-to-date records mapping customer liabilities to the specific Segregated Accounts holding the corresponding funds.\n3.  These records shall be stored securely and be readily accessible to an insolvency practitioner or competent authority.\n4.  The Designated Officer shall review the creditworthiness of the credit institutions holding Segregated Accounts quarterly to mitigate institutional risk.\n\n### 5.4 Management & Oversight\n1.  The Designated Officer has operational responsibility for this policy.\n2.

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Ireland\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-01-31T00:49:44.093006\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company exhibits a complete absence of documented policies and frameworks necessary for stablecoin regulation compliance in Ireland. All critical regulatory requirements are unmet, creating significant legal, operational, and reputational risks. Immediate action is required to develop comprehensive compliance frameworks, with priority given to authorization requirements, capital adequacy, customer fund safeguarding, and AML/CTF compliance. The company should engage legal and compliance experts familiar with Irish and EU financial regulations to develop and implement necessary policies before commencing any stablecoin-related operations.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Authorization requirement for electronic money institutions (EMIs) or payment institutions issuing stablecoins under EU

policies addressing minimum capital requirements, own funds calculations, and prudential safeguards for stablecoin issuance\n\n**Impact:** Regulatory non-compliance, insufficient financial resilience, potential insolvency risks, and supervisory intervention\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish capital adequacy framework including: 1) Minimum capital calculation methodology 2) Capital conservation buffer policies 3) Regular capital adequacy assessments 4) Stress testing procedures\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Safeguarding of customer funds requirements under Article 7 of EMD2 and PSD2\n\n**Current Status:** No documented customer fund safeguarding policies\n\n**Gap:** Missing policies for segregation of customer funds, protection against insolvency, and appropriate safeguarding arrangements\n\n**Impact:** Loss of customer funds in insolvency, regulatory sanctions, loss of customer trust, and potential civil liability\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive safeguarding framework: 1) Segregation of customer funds in separate accounts 2) Daily reconciliation procedures 3) Insolvency protection mechanisms 4) Regular auditing of safeguarding arrangements\n\n### Gap 4: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance under Irish Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Acts and EU AML Directives\n\n**Current Status:** No documented AML/CTF policies or procedures\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of AML/CTF framework including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting\n\n**Impact:** Criminal liability, substantial fines, regulatory enforcement, and reputational damage\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive AML/CTF program: 1) Risk-based customer due diligence procedures 2) Transaction monitoring system 3) Suspicious activity reporting protocols 4) Designated compliance officer appointment 5) Regular staff training\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection requirements including transparency, disclosure, and complaint handling under EU and Irish consumer protection laws\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish consumer protection framework: 1) Clear disclosure documents 2) Fair terms and conditions 3) Transparent fee structure 4) Formal complaint handling procedure 5) Redress mechanisms\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-006\n**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity requirements under EU Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) and Central Bank of Ireland expectations\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement operational resilience framework: 1) ICT risk management program 2) Incident response plan 3) Business continuity and disaster recovery plans 4) Third-party service provider oversight 5) Regular testing and updating\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-007\n**Requirement:** Governance and risk management requirements including fit and proper assessments for management under Central Bank of Ireland requirements\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish comprehensive governance framework: 1) Board composition and committee structure 2) Fit and proper assessments for management 3) Risk appetite statement 4) Three lines of defense model 5) Regular board reporting\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **regulatory_authorization**: not_met\n❌
