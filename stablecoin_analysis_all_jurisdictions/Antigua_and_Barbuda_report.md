# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T05:34:01.117046

## Executive Summary
The company currently has no documented policies addressing Antigua and Barbuda's stablecoin regulatory requirements under the Digital Asset Business Act 2020. This represents a critical compliance gap that prevents lawful operation in this jurisdiction. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive regulatory compliance framework before pursuing stablecoin operations in Antigua and Barbuda. The priority should be addressing licensing requirements, AML/CTF compliance, and capital adequacy, as these are fundamental to obtaining regulatory approval. Given the limited research results obtained, it is strongly recommended to engage local legal counsel to obtain complete and current regulatory requirements.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance requires licensing under Antigua and Barbuda's Digital Asset Business Act (DABA) 2020

**Current Status:** No documented policy for stablecoin issuance or digital asset licensing

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing licensing requirements for stablecoin operations in Antigua and Barbuda

**Impact:** Operating without required license could result in regulatory enforcement, fines, business suspension, and reputational damage

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive licensing application policy and procedures aligned with DABA requirements; engage local legal counsel to navigate licensing process

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Minimum capital requirements for digital asset businesses (specific amounts not available but typically required)

**Current Status:** No capital adequacy or reserve requirements documented

**Gap:** Missing policies for maintaining required capital reserves for stablecoin operations

**Impact:** Failure to meet capital requirements could prevent licensing approval or lead to license revocation

**Recommendation:** Establish capital adequacy policy with reserve requirements; conduct financial modeling to determine appropriate reserve levels

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance under DABA and local AML laws

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CTF policies specific to stablecoin operations

**Gap:** Lack of AML/CTF framework tailored to stablecoin transactions and customer verification

**Impact:** Significant regulatory risk, potential criminal liability, and inability to obtain necessary licenses

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive AML/CTF policy including KYC procedures, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and staff training

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including disclosure requirements and redemption rights

**Recommendation:** Create consumer protection policy with clear redemption procedures, fee disclosures, and complaint resolution mechanisms

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Cybersecurity and operational resilience requirements for digital asset businesses

**Recommendation:** Develop cybersecurity framework including secure key management, multi-signature protocols, incident response plan, and regular security audits

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Governance and risk management framework requirements

**Recommendation:** Establish governance policy with clear roles and responsibilities, risk management framework, and regular compliance reporting
