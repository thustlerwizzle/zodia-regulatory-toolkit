## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE GAPS IDENTIFIED. The company currently has no documented policies addressing stablecoin regulatory requirements for Saint Pierre and Miquelon jurisdiction. All fundamental regulatory requirements appear unmet based on available information. Immediate action is required to: 1) Conduct proper regulatory research through local legal counsel, 2) Develop comprehensive policy framework addressing licensing, reserves, AML/CFT, consumer protection, and operational risks, 3) Establish governance structures for ongoing compliance monitoring. The company should consider suspending any stablecoin operations in this jurisdiction until basic compliance frameworks are established to avoid severe regulatory consequences.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance and operation require specific licensing or authorization from financial authorities in Saint Pierre and Miquelon (likely under French/EU regulatory framework).

**Current Status:** No documented policy exists regarding stablecoin operations in Saint Pierre and Miquelon jurisdiction.

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing stablecoin regulatory requirements for this specific jurisdiction.

**Impact:** Potential for regulatory enforcement actions, fines, license revocation, and reputational damage if operating without proper authorization.

**Recommendation:** 1. Conduct comprehensive regulatory research on stablecoin regulations in Saint Pierre and Miquelon (consult local legal counsel). 2. Develop jurisdiction-specific policy framework addressing licensing requirements, operational standards, and reporting obligations.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must maintain adequate reserves (likely 100% backing) with regular independent audits and public disclosure.

**Current Status:** No reserve management or audit policies documented for stablecoin operations.

**Gap:** Missing policies governing reserve composition, custody, audit frequency, and public disclosure requirements.

**Impact:** Risk of regulatory sanctions for insufficient reserves, loss of consumer confidence, and potential insolvency events.

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive reserve management policy including: asset composition requirements, custody arrangements, monthly/quarterly attestation requirements, and public disclosure protocols.

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting (aligned with French/EU AML directives).

**Current Status:** No specific AML/CFT policies for stablecoin operations in this jurisdiction.

**Gap:** Lack of jurisdiction-specific AML/CFT procedures for stablecoin transactions and customer onboarding.

**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties for AML/CFT violations, potential criminal liability, and loss of banking relationships.

**Recommendation:** Create AML/CFT policy specific to stablecoin operations including: risk assessment methodology, customer identification procedures, transaction monitoring thresholds, and reporting mechanisms to local authorities.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including clear disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling procedures.

**Recommendation:** Develop consumer protection policy covering: clear risk disclosures, redemption procedures and timelines, complaint handling process, and dispute resolution mechanisms.

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational risk management including cybersecurity, business continuity, and technology governance.

**Recommendation:** Establish operational risk framework specific to stablecoin operations including: smart contract audit requirements, cybersecurity standards, key management protocols, and business continuity planning.

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Regular regulatory reporting to local authorities (frequency and content unspecified due to research limitations).

**Recommendation:** Develop regulatory reporting policy after determining specific requirements through local legal consultation. Include reporting schedules, content requirements, and responsible parties.
