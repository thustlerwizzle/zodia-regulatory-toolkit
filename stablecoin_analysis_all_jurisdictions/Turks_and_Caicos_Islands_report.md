# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-12T13:38:41.700590

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits a complete absence of documented policies addressing stablecoin regulatory requirements. Based on international regulatory trends and Turks and Caicos Islands' likely alignment with Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF) standards, all critical regulatory areas show significant gaps. The company is currently non-compliant and faces substantial regulatory, operational, and reputational risks. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive compliance framework before engaging in stablecoin operations. Priority should be given to licensing strategy, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance, as these represent the most critical regulatory requirements with the highest potential impact if unaddressed.
