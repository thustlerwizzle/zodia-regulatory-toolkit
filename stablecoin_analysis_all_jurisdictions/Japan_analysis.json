All regulatory requirements under Japan's Payment Services Act and related financial regulations are currently unmet. This represents a critical compliance failure that prevents legal operation of stablecoin services. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive compliance framework before any market operations can commence. The priority should be addressing licensing requirements, fund segregation, and AML/CTF compliance, as these represent the most immediate barriers to legal operation and carry the highest regulatory risks."

Purpose and Scope\n### 2.1 Purpose\nThe purpose of this policy is to establish strict controls and procedures to ensure the complete segregation of customer funds from corporate operational funds, and to ensure that stablecoin reserves are fully backed, securely held, and regularly verified. This policy is designed to protect customer assets, maintain operational integrity, and ensure compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements.\n\n### 2.2 Scope\nThis policy applies to all employees, contractors, directors, and officers of [Company Name] (the \"Company\") involved in the custody, management, accounting, or auditing of:\n*   Customer fiat currency deposits.\n*   Customer digital asset holdings (excluding stablecoins issued by the Company).\n*   Reserve assets backing the Company's issued stablecoins.\n*   The Company's operational funds.\n\nThis policy governs all relevant activities, including treasury management, accounting practices, internal controls, and external audits.\n\n## 3.

The market value of the Reserve Assets must equal or exceed this total at all times.\n*   **Custody:** A minimum of [e.g., 95%] of Reserve Assets must be held with Qualified Custodians as defined by applicable regulation. Any portion held internally requires explicit Board approval and enhanced security controls.\n\n### 5.3 Audits and Attestations\n*   **Internal Audit:** The Internal Audit function (or designated compliance personnel) shall conduct quarterly reviews to verify compliance with this policy, including testing the effectiveness of segregation controls and reserve calculations.\n*   **External Attestation:** The Company shall engage an independent, reputable accounting firm to perform a monthly attestation on the adequacy of the Stablecoin Reserves.

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Japan\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-01-31T06:07:20.248310\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company exhibits a complete lack of documented policies and procedures necessary for stablecoin operations in Japan. All regulatory requirements under Japan's Payment Services Act and related financial regulations are currently unmet. This represents a critical compliance failure that prevents legal operation of stablecoin services. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive compliance framework before any market operations can commence. The priority should be addressing licensing requirements, fund segregation, and AML/CTF compliance, as these represent the most immediate barriers to legal operation and carry the highest regulatory risks.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Registration as Electronic Payment Instruments Service Provider under Payment Services Act (PSA)\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy for regulatory registration\n\n**Gap:** Company lacks policies and procedures for obtaining required licenses to operate stablecoin services in Japan\n\n**Impact:** Operating without proper registration constitutes illegal activity, leading to regulatory enforcement, fines, business suspension, and criminal liability\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish registration framework with Financial Services Agency (FSA), develop licensing roadmap, and implement compliance monitoring for registration requirements\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Segregation of customer funds and stablecoin reserves\n\n**Current Status:** No documented fund segregation policy\n\n**Gap:** Missing policies for separating customer funds from company assets and maintaining adequate reserves\n\n**Impact:** Risk of commingling funds, insufficient reserves, and inability to honor redemptions, leading to customer losses and regulatory sanctions\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement strict fund segregation policies, establish reserve management procedures, and conduct regular audits of reserve adequacy\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance under PSA and Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (FIEA)\n\n**Current Status:** No documented AML/CTF program\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting procedures\n\n**Impact:** High risk of facilitating illicit financial activities, significant regulatory penalties, and reputational damage\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive AML/CTF program including KYC procedures, transaction monitoring systems, and suspicious activity reporting protocols\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including disclosure requirements\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive disclosure framework, develop clear terms of service, and establish customer complaint handling procedures\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Cybersecurity and operational risk management\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish cybersecurity framework aligned with FSA guidelines, implement multi-signature wallets, cold storage policies, and incident response plans\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **Registration and licensing requirements**: not_met\n❌ **Fund segregation and reserve requirements**: not_met\n❌ **AML/CTF compliance**: not_met\n❌ **Consumer protection measures**: not_met\n❌ **Cybersecurity requirements**:
