# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T21:10:11.880648

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits critical compliance deficiencies across all major regulatory domains for stablecoin operations in Croatia. There is a complete absence of documented policies addressing Croatian regulatory requirements under MiCA implementation and national financial regulations. The most critical gaps involve operating without proper authorization, lacking reserve management controls, and missing AML/CTF programs. Immediate action is required to suspend operations and develop comprehensive compliance frameworks before engaging with Croatian regulators or customers. All identified gaps require urgent attention, with licensing and reserve management being the highest priority for regulatory engagement.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must be authorized as electronic money institutions (EMIs) or credit institutions under Croatian law, implementing EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation framework.

**Current Status:** No documented policy for stablecoin issuance or regulatory authorization requirements.

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing licensing requirements for stablecoin operations in Croatia. Company lacks procedures for obtaining EMI or credit institution authorization.

**Impact:** Operating without proper authorization could result in regulatory enforcement actions, fines, license revocation, and criminal liability for executives.

**Recommendation:** Immediately suspend stablecoin operations in Croatia until authorization is obtained. Develop a regulatory licensing strategy and establish a compliance team to pursue EMI or credit institution authorization under Croatian National Bank supervision.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must maintain 1:1 reserve backing with high-quality liquid assets, subject to regular independent audits and reporting to Croatian Financial Services Supervisory Agency (HANFA).

**Current Status:** No reserve management policy, audit requirements, or reporting procedures documented.

**Gap:** Missing policies for reserve composition, custody, audit frequency, and regulatory reporting. No framework for ensuring 1:1 backing with appropriate assets.

**Impact:** Failure to maintain proper reserves could lead to insolvency, loss of consumer funds, regulatory sanctions, and loss of market confidence.

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive reserve management policy specifying eligible assets, custody arrangements, audit requirements (quarterly independent audits), and reporting templates for HANFA. Implement real-time reserve monitoring systems.

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Implementation of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) measures as per Croatian AML Act, including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and reporting to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU).

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CTF program specific to stablecoin operations.

**Gap:** Lack of risk-based AML/CTF program addressing stablecoin-specific risks. No procedures for customer identification, transaction monitoring, or suspicious activity reporting.

**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties, potential criminal liability, reputational damage, and possible exclusion from the financial system.

**Recommendation:** Develop and implement a comprehensive AML/CTF program including: 1) Risk assessment methodology, 2) Customer identification and verification procedures, 3) Transaction monitoring rules for blockchain transactions, 4) Suspicious activity reporting procedures to Croatian FIU.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection requirements including clear disclosures, redemption rights, complaint handling procedures, and segregation of client funds.

**Recommendation:** Develop consumer protection framework including: 1) Standardized disclosure documents in Croatian language, 2) Clear redemption procedures with timelines, 3) Formal complaint handling process, 4) Segregation of client funds policy with regular reconciliation.

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity requirements including incident reporting to HANFA within specified timeframes.

**Recommendation:** Develop incident response plan specifically addressing stablecoin operations, including: 1) Cybersecurity standards, 2) Incident classification criteria, 3) Reporting procedures to HANFA (within 4 hours for major incidents), 4) Business continuity and disaster recovery plans.
