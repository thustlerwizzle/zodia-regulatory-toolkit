All fundamental requirements for stablecoin issuance are unmet. The most urgent issue is the jurisdictional uncertainty surrounding Artsakh, which must be resolved before any operations can proceed legally. Immediate action is required to: (1) Determine applicable regulatory regime, (2) Establish basic licensing framework, (3) Implement AML/CFT program, and (4) Create reserve management policies. The company should not engage in any stablecoin-related activities until these critical gaps are addressed to avoid severe legal and financial consequences."

Policy Title\nStablecoin Issuance Regulatory Licensing and Registration Policy\n\n## 2. Purpose and Scope\n### 2.1 Purpose\nThis policy establishes a formal framework to ensure that all stablecoin issuance activities conducted by or on behalf of the organization comply with applicable regulatory licensing and registration requirements. It aims to mitigate legal, financial, and reputational risks by providing clear procedures for identifying the correct regulatory jurisdiction and fulfilling associated obligations.\n\n### 2.2 Scope\nThis policy applies to:\n*   All departments, subsidiaries, and employees involved in the development, issuance, marketing, or management of stablecoins.\n*   Any third-party service providers engaged in activities related to stablecoin issuance on behalf of the organization.\n*   All proposed and existing stablecoin projects, regardless of the underlying technology or reserve asset composition.\n\n## 3. Definitions\n*   **Stablecoin:** A type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified asset or a pool of assets, typically a fiat currency like the US Dollar or Euro.\n*   **Issuance:** The act of creating and distributing stablecoin tokens to holders.\n*   **Regulatory Authority:** A government agency responsible for supervising and regulating financial services and markets.\n*   **Applicable Jurisdiction:** The legal territory whose laws and regulations govern the stablecoin issuance activity.\n*   **De Facto Authorities:** Entities exercising administrative control over a region, irrespective of international recognition.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\nIt is the policy of this organization that no stablecoin shall be issued without first:\n1.  Determining the correct Applicable Jurisdiction and corresponding Regulatory Authority.\n2.  Securing all necessary licenses, registrations, or approvals from said authority.\n3.  Maintaining all regulatory conditions and reporting requirements for the duration of the stablecoin's issuance.\n\nFailure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, termination of the project, and legal penalties for the organization and responsible individuals.\n\n## 5. Procedures\n\n### 5.1 Jurisdiction Determination Procedure\nGiven the unclear status of Artsakh, the following decision hierarchy shall be followed to determine the Applicable Jurisdiction for any new stablecoin project:\n\n1.  **Initial Assessment:** The Compliance Department, in consultation with Legal Counsel, will conduct an assessment based on:\n    *   The physical location of issuance operations and key personnel.\n    *   The primary target market and user base.\n    *   The location of reserve asset custodians.\n    *   The legal domicile of the issuing entity.\n    *   Current international law and treaty interpretations regarding territorial status.\n\n2.  **Hierarchical Decision Framework:**\n    *   **Primary Path:** If a clear and operable regulatory framework for stablecoins exists in **Armenia** and the issuance has substantive links to Armenian territory or law, Armenian jurisdiction shall be pursued.\n    *   **Secondary Path:** If the issuance is materially connected to territories under the administrative control of **de facto authorities** (with consideration of the historical context of Artsakh), and engagement is deemed necessary and prudent, a specialized risk assessment must be completed. This requires explicit pre-approval from the Executive Committee and Board, acknowledging the potential for non-recognition and associated risks.\n    *   **Alternative Path:** If the project is primarily oriented towards the **Russian** market or involves significant Russian reserve assets/partners, and an Armenian nexus is insufficient, Russian regulatory licensing must be secured. This path is subject to stringent sanctions compliance checks.\n\n3.  **Documentation:** The rationale for the jurisdiction determination must be thoroughly documented and retained in the project's permanent compliance file.\n\n### 5.2 Licensing and Registration Procedure\n1.  **Pre-Application:** Upon jurisdiction determination, the Compliance Department will obtain and review all relevant regulatory application guidelines.\n2.  **Application Preparation:** A cross-functional team (Compliance, Legal, Finance, Technology) will prepare the complete application package, including but not limited to:\n    *   Business plan and whitepaper.\n    *   Technical architecture and security audits.\n    *   Reserve asset management and custody framework.\n    *   Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) policies.\n    *   Financial projections and risk disclosures.\n3.  **Submission and Liaison:** The Compliance Department will submit the application and serve as the primary point of contact with the Regulatory Authority.\n4.  **Approval and Commencement:** No operational activity may commence until written approval or license is received. A copy of the license must be filed with the Corporate Secretary.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n*   **License Maintenance:** All regulatory conditions attached to the license (e.g., capital requirements, reporting, audits) must be strictly adhered to. The Compliance Department is responsible for tracking and meeting all ongoing obligations.\n*   **Reporting:** Any material changes to the stablecoin project (e.g., change in reserve assets, fee structure, governance) must be pre-approved by the relevant Regulatory Authority as required.\n*   **Record Keeping:** All records related to the license application, communications with authorities, and compliance reports must be maintained for a minimum of seven (7) years after the stablecoin is retired.\n*   **Training:** Relevant personnel must complete annual training on this policy and associated regulatory requirements.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule\nThis policy shall be reviewed and updated:\n*   **Annually** by the Compliance Department and Legal Counsel.\n*   **Immediately** following any material change in the regulatory landscape of the Applicable Jurisdiction or the international legal status of relevant territories.\n*   All revisions require approval from the Chief Compliance Officer and General Counsel.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements\nThis policy is designed to satisfy core regulatory principles common to stablecoin regimes globally, including but not limited to:\n*   **Licensing/Registration Mandate:** Directly addresses the requirement for formal authorization prior to issuance.\n*   **Consumer Protection:** Ensures transparency and adequacy of reserve assets.\n*   **Market Integrity:** Through AML/CTF integration and operational controls.\n*   **Financial Stability:** Via governance and risk management frameworks.\n\n*Note: Specific regulatory statutes will be referenced in an addendum once an Applicable Jurisdiction is determined for a concrete project. This policy provides the procedural framework to achieve compliance with those future, specific requirements.*\n```"

Policy Title\nStablecoin Issuance Regulatory Licensing and Registration Policy\n\n## 2. Purpose and Scope\n### 2.1 Purpose\nThis policy establishes a formal framework to ensure that all stablecoin issuance activities conducted by or on behalf of the organization comply with applicable regulatory licensing and registration requirements. It aims to mitigate legal, financial, and reputational risks by providing clear procedures for identifying the correct regulatory jurisdiction and fulfilling associated obligations.\n\n### 2.2 Scope\nThis policy applies to:\n*   All departments, subsidiaries, and employees involved in the development, issuance, marketing, or management of stablecoins.\n*   Any third-party service providers engaged in activities related to stablecoin issuance on behalf of the organization.\n*   All proposed and existing stablecoin projects, regardless of the underlying technology or reserve asset composition.\n\n## 3. Definitions\n*   **Stablecoin:** A type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified asset or a pool of assets, typically a fiat currency like the US Dollar or Euro.\n*   **Issuance:** The act of creating and distributing stablecoin tokens to holders.\n*   **Regulatory Authority:** A government agency responsible for supervising and regulating financial services and markets.\n*   **Applicable Jurisdiction:** The legal territory whose laws and regulations govern the stablecoin issuance activity.\n*   **De Facto Authorities:** Entities exercising administrative control over a region, irrespective of international recognition.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\nIt is the policy of this organization that no stablecoin shall be issued without first:\n1.  Determining the correct Applicable Jurisdiction and corresponding Regulatory Authority.\n2.  Securing all necessary licenses, registrations, or approvals from said authority.\n3.  Maintaining all regulatory conditions and reporting requirements for the duration of the stablecoin's issuance.\n\nFailure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, termination of the project, and legal penalties for the organization and responsible individuals.\n\n## 5. Procedures\n\n### 5.1 Jurisdiction Determination Procedure\nGiven the unclear status of Artsakh, the following decision hierarchy shall be followed to determine the Applicable Jurisdiction for any new stablecoin project:\n\n1.  **Initial Assessment:** The Compliance Department, in consultation with Legal Counsel, will conduct an assessment based on:\n    *   The physical location of issuance operations and key personnel.\n    *   The primary target market and user base.\n    *   The location of reserve asset custodians.\n    *   The legal domicile of the issuing entity.\n    *   Current international law and treaty interpretations regarding territorial status.\n\n2.  **Hierarchical Decision Framework:**\n    *   **Primary Path:** If a clear and operable regulatory framework for stablecoins exists in **Armenia** and the issuance has substantive links to Armenian territory or law, Armenian jurisdiction shall be pursued.\n    *   **Secondary Path:** If the issuance is materially connected to territories under the administrative control of **de facto authorities** (with consideration of the historical context of Artsakh), and engagement is deemed necessary and prudent, a specialized risk assessment must be completed. This requires explicit pre-approval from the Executive Committee and Board, acknowledging the potential for non-recognition and associated risks.\n    *   **Alternative Path:** If the project is primarily oriented towards the **Russian** market or involves significant Russian reserve assets/partners, and an Armenian nexus is insufficient, Russian regulatory licensing must be secured. This path is subject to stringent sanctions compliance checks.\n\n3.  **Documentation:** The rationale for the jurisdiction determination must be thoroughly documented and retained in the project's permanent compliance file.\n\n### 5.2 Licensing and Registration Procedure\n1.  **Pre-Application:** Upon jurisdiction determination, the Compliance Department will obtain and review all relevant regulatory application guidelines.\n2.  **Application Preparation:** A cross-functional team (Compliance, Legal, Finance, Technology) will prepare the complete application package, including but not limited to:\n    *   Business plan and whitepaper.\n    *   Technical architecture and security audits.\n    *   Reserve asset management and custody framework.\n    *   Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) policies.\n    *   Financial projections and risk disclosures.\n3.  **Submission and Liaison:** The Compliance Department will submit the application and serve as the primary point of contact with the Regulatory Authority.\n4.  **Approval and Commencement:** No operational activity may commence until written approval or license is received. A copy of the license must be filed with the Corporate Secretary.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n*   **License Maintenance:** All regulatory conditions attached to the license (e.g., capital requirements, reporting, audits) must be strictly adhered to. The Compliance Department is responsible for tracking and meeting all ongoing obligations.\n*   **Reporting:** Any material changes to the stablecoin project (e.g., change in reserve assets, fee structure, governance) must be pre-approved by the relevant Regulatory Authority as required.\n*   **Record Keeping:** All records related to the license application, communications with authorities, and compliance reports must be maintained for a minimum of seven (7) years after the stablecoin is retired.\n*   **Training:** Relevant personnel must complete annual training on this policy and associated regulatory requirements.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule\nThis policy shall be reviewed and updated:\n*   **Annually** by the Compliance Department and Legal Counsel.\n*   **Immediately** following any material change in the regulatory landscape of the Applicable Jurisdiction or the international legal status of relevant territories.\n*   All revisions require approval from the Chief Compliance Officer and General Counsel.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements\nThis policy is designed to satisfy core regulatory principles common to stablecoin regimes globally, including but not limited to:\n*   **Licensing/Registration Mandate:** Directly addresses the requirement for formal authorization prior to issuance.\n*   **Consumer Protection:** Ensures transparency and adequacy of reserve assets.\n*   **Market Integrity:** Through AML/CTF integration and operational controls.\n*   **Financial Stability:** Via governance and risk management frameworks.\n\n*Note: Specific regulatory statutes will be referenced in an addendum once an Applicable Jurisdiction is determined for a concrete project. This policy provides the procedural framework to achieve compliance with those future, specific requirements.*\n```"

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Artsakh\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-02-12T18:26:28.973616\n\n## Executive Summary\nCRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company lacks any documented policies for stablecoin operations, representing a complete regulatory compliance failure. All fundamental requirements for stablecoin issuance are unmet. The most urgent issue is the jurisdictional uncertainty surrounding Artsakh, which must be resolved before any operations can proceed legally. Immediate action is required to: (1) Determine applicable regulatory regime, (2) Establish basic licensing framework, (3) Implement AML/CFT program, and (4) Create reserve management policies. The company should not engage in any stablecoin-related activities until these critical gaps are addressed to avoid severe legal and financial consequences.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance requires licensing/registration with financial authorities\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy for stablecoin issuance or regulatory registration\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing stablecoin regulatory licensing requirements\n\n**Impact:** Legal prohibition from operating, severe penalties, criminal liability for executives\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish regulatory licensing framework; determine applicable jurisdiction (Artsakh status unclear - consider Armenian, Russian, or de facto authorities); create registration procedures\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Reserve requirements for stablecoin issuers (typically 100% backing with high-quality liquid assets)\n\n**Current Status:** No reserve management or asset backing policies\n\n**Gap:** No policies governing reserve composition, custody, auditing, or transparency\n\n**Impact:** Insolvency risk, loss of consumer confidence, regulatory enforcement actions, potential fraud allegations\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive reserve policy specifying: asset types (cash, treasuries), custody arrangements, independent auditing, regular reporting, and redemption procedures\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance including KYC, transaction monitoring, and reporting\n\n**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT program\n\n**Gap:** Missing entire anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing framework\n\n**Impact:** Severe regulatory sanctions, loss of banking relationships, criminal prosecution, inclusion on international watchlists\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement full AML/CFT program: customer identification, risk assessment, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, staff training, and independent testing\n\n### Gap 4: GAP-007\n**Requirement:** Jurisdictional analysis and legal authority determination\n\n**Current Status:** No analysis of Artsakh's regulatory status or applicable laws\n\n**Gap:** Unclear which regulatory regime applies given Artsakh's contested political status\n\n**Impact:** Operating in legal vacuum, potential violation of multiple jurisdictions' laws, international sanctions risk\n\n**Recommendation:** Conduct urgent legal analysis: determine if Armenian law applies, assess Russian influence, evaluate de facto authorities' regulations, consider international sanctions implications\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling\n\n**Recommendation:** Create consumer protection framework: clear terms of service, redemption policy, fee disclosures, complaint procedures, and privacy protections\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Operational risk management including cybersecurity and business continuity\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop operational risk framework: cybersecurity standards, incident response, business continuity planning, third-party vendor management, and insurance requirements\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-006\n**Requirement:** Governance and oversight requirements including board accountability and compliance function\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish governance framework: board oversight committee, designated compliance officer, regular compliance reporting, and independent audit committee\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **licensing_registration**: not_met\n❌ **reserve_requirements**: not_met\n❌ **aml_cft_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **consumer_protection**: not_met\n❌ **operational_risk**: not_met\n❌ **governance_oversight**: not_met\n❌ **jurisdictional_compliance**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update Summary\nGenerated: 2026-02-12T18:27:07.347276\n\n## Overview\nThis document summarizes proposed updates to company policies and standards based on regulatory gap analysis.\n\n## New Policies Required\n\n## Modified Policies\n\n### GAP-001\n**Category:** Compliance\n**Current Policy:** No documented policy for stablecoin issuance or regulatory registration\n**Proposed Change:** Establish regulatory licensing framework;
