# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-06T02:07:26.410447

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits significant regulatory compliance gaps across all major areas of Mauritius stablecoin regulation. Current policies are either non-existent or insufficient to meet Financial Services Commission requirements. Critical gaps exist in licensing, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance. Immediate action is required to develop comprehensive policies and initiate licensing applications to avoid regulatory enforcement actions. The company should prioritize establishing basic compliance infrastructure before commencing or continuing stablecoin operations in Mauritius.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Licensing requirement for stablecoin issuers under Mauritius Financial Services Act and Virtual Asset and Initial Token Offering Services Act 2021

**Current Status:** No documented policy on licensing requirements or regulatory registration

**Gap:** Company lacks policies addressing the mandatory licensing/registration with Financial Services Commission (FSC) for stablecoin issuance activities

**Impact:** Operating without proper license could result in regulatory enforcement actions, fines, business suspension, and reputational damage

**Recommendation:** Develop licensing framework policy and initiate FSC application process for Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Reserve requirements and asset backing for stablecoins (typically 1:1 backing with high-quality liquid assets)

**Current Status:** No documented reserve management or asset backing policies

**Gap:** Missing policies governing reserve composition, custody, audit requirements, and redemption mechanisms

**Impact:** Failure to maintain adequate reserves could lead to insolvency, loss of peg, regulatory sanctions, and loss of consumer trust

**Recommendation:** Create comprehensive reserve management policy including asset composition rules, custody arrangements, and independent audit requirements

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance under Financial Intelligence and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2002

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT policies specific to stablecoin operations

**Gap:** Lacks customer due diligence (CDD), transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and record-keeping procedures for stablecoin transactions

**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties, potential criminal liability, and inclusion in international watchlists

**Recommendation:** Develop VASP-specific AML/CFT program with risk-based approach, CDD procedures, and transaction monitoring systems

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive consumer protection framework including clear disclosures, redemption policies, and complaint resolution procedures

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Cybersecurity and operational resilience requirements

**Recommendation:** Establish cybersecurity framework meeting FSC guidelines for VASPs, including cold storage policies and incident response plans

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Governance and risk management framework

**Recommendation:** Implement three lines of defense model with clear governance structure, risk appetite statement, and compliance monitoring
