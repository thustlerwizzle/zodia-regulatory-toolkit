# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-31T06:19:16.493087

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits significant compliance gaps across all major regulatory domains for stablecoin operations in Kazakhstan. Current policies are either non-existent or insufficient to meet regulatory expectations. The most critical gaps relate to licensing, reserve management, and AML/CTF compliance, which could result in severe regulatory consequences. Immediate action is required to develop comprehensive policy frameworks and engage with Kazakh regulators to ensure compliance with evolving digital asset regulations. Given the nascent but developing regulatory landscape in Kazakhstan, proactive compliance measures are essential to establish operational legitimacy and mitigate regulatory risks.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Legal authorization and licensing for stablecoin issuance and operations in Kazakhstan

**Current Status:** No documented policy found regarding licensing requirements

**Gap:** Company lacks policies addressing the need for specific licenses from the National Bank of Kazakhstan or other regulatory bodies to operate stablecoin services

**Impact:** Potential for regulatory enforcement actions, fines, or complete shutdown of operations

**Recommendation:** Develop licensing strategy and policy framework; engage with National Bank of Kazakhstan to understand specific licensing requirements

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Reserve requirements and asset backing for stablecoins

**Current Status:** No documented reserve management policy

**Gap:** No policies governing the composition, custody, or verification of reserve assets backing stablecoins

**Impact:** Risk of regulatory non-compliance, loss of consumer trust, and potential insolvency issues

**Recommendation:** Establish comprehensive reserve management policy including asset composition requirements, custody arrangements, and regular independent audits

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CTF policy specific to stablecoin operations

**Gap:** Lack of policies for customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting for stablecoin transactions

**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties, reputational damage, and potential criminal liability

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive AML/CTF program tailored to stablecoin operations, including KYC procedures, transaction monitoring, and reporting protocols

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements

**Recommendation:** Create comprehensive consumer protection framework including clear disclosures, complaint handling procedures, and user education materials

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Cybersecurity and operational resilience requirements

**Recommendation:** Develop cybersecurity framework including secure key management, multi-signature protocols, incident response plans, and regular security audits
