# Gap Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
The company is in a state of total non-compliance. No policies were provided for analysis, indicating a complete absence of the foundational governance, risk, and compliance frameworks required to operate a regulated financial instrument like a stablecoin. The gaps are systemic and severe. Immediate action is required to develop all critical policies from the ground up, with a primary focus on legal authorization, AML/CFT, and reserve management before any operational activity can be considered. Engagement with Honduran regulators and specialized legal counsel is the first and most critical step.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Legal authorization to issue stablecoins. Most jurisdictions require specific licensing or registration for stablecoin issuers, often under payment services, e-money, or specific digital asset frameworks.

**Current Status:** No policy identified. The company policies document is empty, indicating no formal governance framework exists.

**Gap:** Complete absence of any policy or procedure addressing the legal foundation for operating a stablecoin service. There is no evidence of licensing strategy, regulatory engagement, or legal risk assessment.

**Impact:** Operating without proper authorization could lead to immediate enforcement actions, including cease-and-desist orders, significant fines, criminal liability for directors, and reputational damage making future licensing impossible.

**Recommendation:** 1. Immediately suspend any operational activity related to stablecoin issuance. 2. Conduct urgent legal research to determine Honduras's specific regulatory stance (consulting local counsel is mandatory). 3. Develop a 'Market Entry and Licensing Strategy' policy outlining the steps to obtain necessary approvals before any product launch.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Robust reserve management and attestation. Global standards (e.g., from IOSCO, FSIB) and many national regulations mandate that stablecoin reserves be held in secure, low-risk assets, fully backed 1:1, and subject to frequent, independent attestation or audit.

**Current Status:** No policy identified.

**Gap:** No policy governing the custody, composition, or verification of reserves backing the stablecoin. There is no framework for asset segregation, redemption procedures, or third-party oversight.

**Impact:** Risk of insolvency and inability to honor redemptions, leading to a 'break-the-buck' event. This would trigger consumer protection lawsuits, regulatory intervention for fraud or misrepresentation, and collapse of trust in the product.

**Recommendation:** Develop a comprehensive 'Reserve Management and Assurance Policy'. This must detail: acceptable reserve assets (e.g., cash, short-term treasuries), custody requirements with qualified custodians, a 1:1 backing mandate, and schedules for monthly attestations and quarterly full-scope audits by a registered public accounting firm.

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (CFT) compliance. This includes KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting (SAR), and sanctions screening, as mandated by FATF recommendations and national AML laws.

**Current Status:** No policy identified.

**Gap:** Complete lack of an AML/CFT program. No procedures for customer identification, ongoing due diligence, monitoring transactions, reporting suspicious activities, or screening against sanctions lists.

**Impact:** High risk of the stablecoin being used for illicit finance, leading to severe regulatory penalties, loss of banking partnerships, de-risking by correspondents, and potential criminal prosecution of the company and its principals.

**Recommendation:** Implement a risk-based AML/CFT Program immediately. This includes: a written policy, appointment of a Compliance Officer, automated KYC/CDD onboarding, real-time transaction monitoring systems, sanctions/PEP screening tools, and procedures for filing SARs with the Honduran Financial Intelligence Unit (UIF).

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure. Regulations typically require clear, fair terms of service, disclosure of risks (including reserve details and redemption rights), and a complaint handling mechanism.

**Recommendation:** Draft and publish clear 'Terms of Service' and a 'Risk Disclosure Statement'. Establish a 'Customer Complaint Resolution Policy' with defined timelines, escalation paths, and logging procedures to ensure issues are tracked and resolved fairly.

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Cybersecurity and operational resilience. Financial regulators expect stringent controls to protect customer data and funds, including incident response plans, business continuity plans, and regular security testing.

**Recommendation:** Develop and implement an 'Information Security Management Policy' aligned with a framework like ISO 27001 or NIST CSF. This must be accompanied by a tested 'Incident Response Plan' and a 'Business Continuity Plan' to ensure service availability and rapid recovery from disruptions.
