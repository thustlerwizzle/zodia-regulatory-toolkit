Prohibit the use of proprietary trading, rehypothecation, or lending of reserve assets.\n3. Legally segregate reserve assets from corporate assets, ensuring they are held for the sole benefit of stablecoin holders and are protected in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency.\n4. Provide transparent, regular, and verifiable reporting on the status of the reserve to build trust and ensure compliance with evolving regulatory standards.\n\n## 5. Procedures\n### 5.1 Reserve Composition & Management\n- The Treasury Department must invest reserve funds exclusively in pre-approved HQLA.\n- A daily reconciliation process will be performed to match the total circulating stablecoin supply with the total market value of the reserve.\n- Any shortfall must be remedied within one (1) business day by depositing additional HQLA.\n\n### 5.2 Custody and Segregation\n- Reserve assets shall be held with one or more qualified, regulated custodians.\n- Custodial agreements must explicitly state that assets are held for the benefit of stablecoin holders and are not subject to claims by the Company's creditors.\n- The Legal and Compliance departments must review and approve all custody agreements.\n\n### 5.3 Audit and Attestation\n- **Monthly Attestation:** An independent accounting firm will perform agreed-upon procedures and issue a public attestation report within 15 business days of month-end.\n- **Annual Audit:** A full annual financial audit of the reserve will be conducted by an independent registered public accounting firm.

Review and Update Schedule\nThis policy shall be reviewed and updated at least annually by the Compliance Committee to ensure alignment with:\n- Changes in applicable laws and regulations (e.g., emerging stablecoin-specific legislation).\n- Evolving best practices in digital asset governance.\n- Operational feedback and audit findings.\n\nThe next scheduled review date is: **[Insert Date, One Year from Effective Date]**\n\n## 8.

All identified regulatory requirements are unmet. Immediate action is required to suspend operations and develop comprehensive compliance framework. The highest priority gaps involve operating without legal authority (licensing) and lacking AML/CFT controls, both of which carry severe legal and financial consequences. The company must engage local legal counsel immediately to understand Burundi's regulatory landscape before proceeding with any operations.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Legal framework for stablecoin issuance and operation in Burundi\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policies found\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing stablecoin operations in Burundi. No legal analysis, licensing requirements, or operational guidelines established.\n\n**Impact:** Operating without legal framework exposes company to regulatory enforcement, fines, license revocation, and potential criminal liability.\n\n**Recommendation:** Immediately suspend stablecoin operations in Burundi until legal analysis is completed. Engage local legal counsel to research Burundi's financial regulations and central bank policies regarding digital assets.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance for digital asset service providers\n\n**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT policies for Burundi operations\n\n**Gap:** No policies addressing customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, or record-keeping requirements specific to Burundi's AML/CFT regime.\n\n**Impact:** High risk of facilitating money laundering or terrorist financing. Potential for severe penalties, reputational damage, and loss of banking relationships.\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive AML/CFT program aligned with Burundi's legal requirements and FATF recommendations. Implement KYC procedures, transaction monitoring systems, and suspicious activity reporting protocols.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-006\n**Requirement:** Licensing and registration with Burundi financial authorities\n\n**Current Status:** No licensing strategy or documentation\n\n**Gap:** No analysis of required licenses, no application process, and no engagement with Burundi's central bank or financial regulators.\n\n**Impact:** Operating without required licenses constitutes illegal financial services provision, subject to immediate shutdown, fines, and potential criminal charges.\n\n**Recommendation:** Immediately research licensing requirements with local counsel. Prepare license application package. Establish regulatory engagement strategy with Bank of the Republic of Burundi.\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Reserve requirements and asset backing for stablecoins\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish reserve management policy requiring 1:1 backing with high-quality liquid assets. Implement regular third-party audits and public attestations. Create segregation of customer funds from company assets.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop localized terms of service, risk disclosure documents, and complaint resolution procedures compliant with Burundi consumer protection laws.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Data privacy and cybersecurity requirements\n\n**Recommendation:** Conduct data protection impact assessment. Develop privacy policy compliant with Burundi's data protection laws. Implement cybersecurity framework with incident response plan.\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **legal_framework**: not_met\n❌ **aml_cft_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **reserve_requirements**: not_met\n❌ **consumer_protection**: not_met\n❌ **data_privacy**: not_met\n❌ **licensing_registration**: not_met\n❌ **tax_compliance**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update Summary\nGenerated: 2026-01-30T19:55:39.039660\n\n## Overview\nThis document summarizes proposed updates to company policies and standards based on regulatory gap analysis.\n\n## New Policies Required\n\n## Modified Policies\n\n### GAP-001\n**Category:** Legal\n**Current Policy:** No documented policies found\n**Proposed Change:** Immediately suspend stablecoin operations in Burundi until legal analysis is completed.
