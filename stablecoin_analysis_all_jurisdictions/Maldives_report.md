# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-06T00:47:50.231349

## Executive Summary
The company currently has no established policies for stablecoin operations, representing a critical compliance gap. Given the absence of specific regulatory research results for Maldives, this analysis is based on international regulatory standards and emerging global stablecoin frameworks. All identified regulatory requirements are currently not met, requiring immediate attention to foundational policy development. Priority should be given to establishing legal compliance, AML/CTF frameworks, and reserve management policies before any stablecoin operations commence. Engagement with the Maldives Monetary Authority is recommended to clarify specific national requirements.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Legal framework for stablecoin issuance and operation in Maldives

**Current Status:** No specific stablecoin policy identified

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing stablecoin operations, including issuance, redemption, reserve management, and consumer protection

**Impact:** Legal and operational risks including potential regulatory sanctions, inability to operate legally, and loss of customer trust

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive stablecoin policy framework aligned with international standards (FSB, BIS) and engage with Maldives Monetary Authority for regulatory clarity

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) requirements for digital assets

**Current Status:** No specific AML/CTF policies for stablecoin transactions

**Gap:** Lack of customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting procedures specific to stablecoin operations

**Impact:** High risk of regulatory enforcement actions, financial penalties, and reputational damage

**Recommendation:** Implement FATF Travel Rule compliance, establish customer identification procedures, and develop transaction monitoring systems for stablecoin flows

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Reserve management and transparency requirements

**Recommendation:** Establish reserve management policy with 1:1 backing, regular third-party audits, and public attestation reports

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements

**Recommendation:** Develop clear terms of service, redemption policies, and establish consumer complaint resolution process

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive operational risk framework including smart contract audits, multi-signature controls, and incident response plans
