Purpose and Scope\n### 2.1 Purpose\nThis policy establishes a comprehensive framework to ensure compliance with French anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regulations, specifically those implementing the European Union’s Fifth and Sixth Anti-Money Laundering Directives (AMLD5/6). Its purpose is to detect, prevent, and report money laundering and terrorist financing activities.\n\n### 2.2 Scope\nThis policy applies to all employees, directors, contractors, and agents of the organization operating in or from Guadeloupe. It covers all business lines, products, and services offered, including but not limited to account management, funds transfers, and any other financial or designated non-financial activities.\n\n## 3. Definitions\n*   **AML/CFT:** Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism.\n*   **AMLD5/6:** The European Union's Fifth and Sixth Anti-Money Laundering Directives, as transposed into French law (primarily Monetary and Financial Code, Articles L. 561-1 et seq. and R. 561-1 et seq.).\n*   **CDD (Customer Due Diligence):** The process of identifying and verifying the identity of a customer and assessing their risk profile.\n*   **EDD (Enhanced Due Diligence):** Heightened scrutiny applied to customers identified as presenting a higher risk of money laundering or terrorist financing.\n*   **PEP (Politically Exposed Person):** An individual who is or has been entrusted with prominent public functions, both domestic and foreign, and their immediate family members or close associates.\n*   **SAR (Suspicious Activity Report):** A report filed with the French Financial Intelligence Unit (TRACFIN) when a suspicious transaction or activity is detected.\n*   **Risk-Based Approach (RBA):** The principle that measures to prevent or mitigate money laundering and terrorist financing should be commensurate with the risks identified.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\nIt is the policy of this organization to fully comply with all applicable AML/CFT laws and regulations in France and the European Union. We are committed to implementing a robust, risk-based AML/CFT program designed to:\n*   Prevent the use of our services for money laundering or terrorist financing.\n*   Identify, assess, and understand our money laundering and terrorist financing risks.\n*   Apply customer due diligence measures, including ongoing monitoring.\n*   Detect and report suspicious transactions to TRACFIN.\n*   Ensure all relevant personnel are trained on AML/CFT obligations.\n*   Maintain appropriate records of all CDD information and transactions for the legally required period (five years from the end of the customer relationship or transaction date).\n\n## 5. Procedures\n\n### 5.1 Risk-Based Approach (RBA) Documentation\n*   The Compliance Officer will conduct and document an annual Enterprise-Wide Risk Assessment (EWRA).\n*   The EWRA will identify and assess ML/FT risks considering factors such as customer types, geographic locations, products/services, delivery channels, and transaction volumes.\n*   The RBA will dictate the level and frequency of CDD and monitoring applied to each customer and business relationship.\n\n### 5.2 Customer Due Diligence (CDD) Procedures\nCDD must be performed upon establishing a business relationship, carrying out an occasional transaction above €15,000, or when there is a suspicion of ML/FT.\n\n#### 5.2.1 Standard CDD includes:\n1.  **Identification & Verification:** Collecting and verifying the customer's identity using reliable, independent source documents (e.g., passport, national ID, company registry extracts).\n2.  **Identification of Beneficial Owner(s):** Identifying and verifying the natural person(s) who ultimately own or control the customer (ownership >25%).\n3.  **Purpose and Nature of the Relationship:** Understanding the intended purpose and nature of the business relationship.\n4.  **Ongoing Monitoring:** Conducting ongoing scrutiny of transactions to ensure they are consistent with the organization's knowledge of the customer, their business, and risk profile.\n\n#### 5.2.2 Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) is required for higher-risk categories, including but not limited to:\n*   PEPs and their family/close associates.\n*   Customers from high-risk third countries identified by the EU or FATF.\n*   Correspondent banking relationships.\n*   Non-face-to-face customers.\n*   EDD measures include obtaining additional information, seeking senior management approval, and increasing the frequency and depth of transaction monitoring.\n\n### 5.3 Transaction Monitoring System\n*   A manual or automated transaction monitoring system will be implemented to detect unusual or potentially suspicious patterns of activity.\n*   Monitoring alerts will be generated based on predefined scenarios aligned with our risk assessment (e.g., structuring, rapid movement of funds, transactions with high-risk jurisdictions).\n*   All alerts will be investigated, analyzed, and documented by designated personnel. Findings will be escalated as necessary.\n\n### 5.4 Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR) Protocols\n1.  Any employee who suspects or has reasonable grounds to suspect a transaction involves proceeds of crime or is related to terrorist financing must immediately report internally to the Compliance Officer.\n2.  The Compliance Officer will conduct a prompt review of the internal report and all relevant information.\n3.  If the suspicion remains, the Compliance Officer will file a SAR with TRACFIN without delay, and in any event, no later than the working day following the day the suspicion was formed.\n4.  The business relationship or transaction in question will be handled in accordance with legal requirements, which may include not proceeding with the transaction and/or freezing assets. The customer will not be informed (\"tipping-off\" is prohibited).\n\n### 5.5 Employee Training Program\n*   All employees will receive mandatory AML/CFT training upon hiring and annually thereafter.\n*   Training will be tailored to the specific responsibilities of the employee (e.g., frontline staff, compliance personnel, senior management).\n*   Training content will cover legal obligations, internal policies, red flag indicators, and reporting procedures.\n*   Attendance and comprehension will be documented.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n*   A designated **Compliance Officer** is appointed with full responsibility for the implementation and oversight of this AML/CFT program. The Officer will serve as the point of contact with TRACFIN.\n*   Independent **internal audit** will review the effectiveness of the AML/CFT program at least annually.\n*   **Record Keeping**: All CDD documents, business correspondence, and transaction records must be kept for a minimum of five years from the end of the relationship or date of the transaction, in accordance with French law.\n*   Failure to comply with this policy will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, and may lead to regulatory sanctions.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule\nThis policy shall be reviewed and updated:\n*   **Annually**, as part of the Enterprise-Wide Risk Assessment cycle.\n*   **Ad-hoc**, in response to significant changes in the business model, products, or geographic reach.\n*   **Immediately**, following any major changes in French or EU AML/CFT regulations.\nAll updates require approval from the Board of Directors or a designated committee.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements\nThis policy is designed to ensure compliance with, but is not limited to, the following regulatory frameworks:\n*   **European Union:** Directive (EU) 2018/843 (AMLD5) and Directive (EU) 2021/555 (AMLD6).\n*   **France:** Monetary and Financial Code (Code monétaire et financier), Articles L. 561-1 to L. 567-8 and R. 561-1 to R. 567-8.\n*   **French Regulatory Authority:** Regulations and guidelines issued by the **Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution (ACPR)** and the **Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF)**, as applicable.\n*   **Financial Intelligence Unit:** Reporting obligations to **TRACFIN** (Traitement du Renseignement et Action contre les Circuits FINanciers clandestins).\n*   **International Standards:** Recommendations of the **Financial Action Task Force (FATF)**.\n\n---\n*Policy Effective Date: [Date]*\n*Approved By: [Name/Title of Approving Authority]*\n*Version: 1.0*\n```"

Definitions\n*   **AML/CFT:** Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism.\n*   **AMLD5/6:** The European Union's Fifth and Sixth Anti-Money Laundering Directives, as transposed into French law (primarily Monetary and Financial Code, Articles L. 561-1 et seq. and R. 561-1 et seq.).\n*   **CDD (Customer Due Diligence):** The process of identifying and verifying the identity of a customer and assessing their risk profile.\n*   **EDD (Enhanced Due Diligence):** Heightened scrutiny applied to customers identified as presenting a higher risk of money laundering or terrorist financing.\n*   **PEP (Politically Exposed Person):** An individual who is or has been entrusted with prominent public functions, both domestic and foreign, and their immediate family members or close associates.\n*   **SAR (Suspicious Activity Report):** A report filed with the French Financial Intelligence Unit (TRACFIN) when a suspicious transaction or activity is detected.\n*   **Risk-Based Approach (RBA):** The principle that measures to prevent or mitigate money laundering and terrorist financing should be commensurate with the risks identified.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\nIt is the policy of this organization to fully comply with all applicable AML/CFT laws and regulations in France and the European Union. We are committed to implementing a robust, risk-based AML/CFT program designed to:\n*   Prevent the use of our services for money laundering or terrorist financing.\n*   Identify, assess, and understand our money laundering and terrorist financing risks.\n*   Apply customer due diligence measures, including ongoing monitoring.\n*   Detect and report suspicious transactions to TRACFIN.\n*   Ensure all relevant personnel are trained on AML/CFT obligations.\n*   Maintain appropriate records of all CDD information and transactions for the legally required period (five years from the end of the customer relationship or transaction date).\n\n## 5.

Findings will be escalated as necessary.\n\n### 5.4 Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR) Protocols\n1.  Any employee who suspects or has reasonable grounds to suspect a transaction involves proceeds of crime or is related to terrorist financing must immediately report internally to the Compliance Officer.\n2.

If the suspicion remains, the Compliance Officer will file a SAR with TRACFIN without delay, and in any event, no later than the working day following the day the suspicion was formed.\n4.  The business relationship or transaction in question will be handled in accordance with legal requirements, which may include not proceeding with the transaction and/or freezing assets. The customer will not be informed (\"tipping-off\" is prohibited).\n\n### 5.5 Employee Training Program\n*   All employees will receive mandatory AML/CFT training upon hiring and annually thereafter.\n*   Training will be tailored to the specific responsibilities of the employee (e.g., frontline staff, compliance personnel, senior management).\n*   Training content will cover legal obligations, internal policies, red flag indicators, and reporting procedures.\n*   Attendance and comprehension will be documented.\n\n## 6.

Review and Update Schedule\nThis policy shall be reviewed and updated:\n*   **Annually**, as part of the Enterprise-Wide Risk Assessment cycle.\n*   **Ad-hoc**, in response to significant changes in the business model, products, or geographic reach.\n*   **Immediately**, following any major changes in French or EU AML/CFT regulations.\nAll updates require approval from the Board of Directors or a designated committee.\n\n## 8.

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Guadeloupe\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-02-12T16:39:08.162237\n\n## Executive Summary\nCRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no documented policies addressing stablecoin regulation in Guadeloupe (French jurisdiction). All regulatory requirements are unmet, creating severe legal and operational risks. Immediate action is required to: 1) Suspend any current operations until authorization is obtained, 2) Develop comprehensive compliance framework addressing French/EU regulatory requirements, 3) Engage with French regulators (ACPR) for authorization process. The absence of basic policies indicates fundamental lack of compliance infrastructure for operating as a regulated financial service provider in this jurisdiction.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance and operation requires authorization from French financial authorities (ACPR/Banque de France) as Guadeloupe is an overseas department of France, subject to EU regulations including MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation)\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy for stablecoin operations in Guadeloupe/French jurisdiction\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing authorization requirements, capital requirements, governance, and operational standards for stablecoin issuance in French territories\n\n**Impact:** Legal prohibition of operations, severe regulatory penalties, potential criminal liability for unauthorized financial services, reputational damage\n\n**Recommendation:** Immediately suspend any stablecoin operations in Guadeloupe until proper authorization is obtained. Develop comprehensive authorization strategy including engagement with ACPR, application preparation, and interim compliance measures.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Compliance with EU's MiCA regulation for asset-referenced tokens (ARTs) and e-money tokens (EMTs), including reserve requirements, redemption rights, and disclosure obligations\n\n**Current Status:** No MiCA-specific policies documented\n\n**Gap:** Missing policies for reserve management, redemption mechanisms, white paper requirements, and ongoing disclosure obligations under MiCA framework\n\n**Impact:** Non-compliance with EU-wide regulation, enforcement actions from multiple EU authorities, inability to operate legally in EU/EEA markets\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop MiCA compliance framework including: 1) Reserve management policy with segregation requirements, 2) Redemption policy with clear procedures and timelines, 3) Disclosure policy for white papers and periodic reporting, 4) Governance structure for compliance oversight.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance under French anti-money laundering regulations (implementing EU AMLD5/6) including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and reporting obligations\n\n**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT policies for Guadeloupe operations\n\n**Gap:** Lack of jurisdiction-specific AML/CFT procedures, risk assessment, customer identification, and suspicious activity reporting mechanisms\n\n**Impact:** Significant regulatory fines, criminal prosecution for money laundering offenses, loss of banking relationships, business closure\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive AML/CFT program including: 1) Risk-based approach documentation, 2) Customer due diligence procedures, 3) Transaction monitoring system, 4) Suspicious activity reporting protocols, 5) Employee training program.\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection requirements including clear terms of service, dispute resolution mechanisms, and transparency about risks\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop consumer protection framework including: 1) Clear terms of service and risk disclosures, 2) Complaint handling procedures, 3) Dispute resolution mechanism, 4) Marketing and communication guidelines.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity requirements for financial institutions operating in French jurisdiction\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish operational resilience framework including: 1) Cybersecurity policy aligned with French financial sector requirements, 2) Business continuity and disaster recovery plans, 3) Incident response procedures, 4) Regular security testing and audits.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-006\n**Requirement:** Governance and internal control requirements including board oversight, risk management, and compliance function\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement governance framework including: 1) Board charter with compliance oversight responsibilities, 2) Three lines of defense model, 3) Independent compliance function, 4) Risk management policy, 5) Internal audit program.\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **authorization_requirements**: not_met\n❌ **mica_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **aml_cft_requirements**: not_met\n❌ **consumer_protection**: not_met\n❌ **operational_resilience**: not_met\n❌ **governance_requirements**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update Summary\nGenerated: 2026-02-12T16:39:52.091118\n\n## Overview\nThis document summarizes proposed updates to company policies and standards based on regulatory gap analysis.\n\n## New Policies Required\n\n## Modified Policies\n\n### GAP-001\n**Category:** Compliance\n**Current Policy:** No documented policy for stablecoin operations in Guadeloupe/French jurisdiction\n**Proposed Change:** Immediately suspend any stablecoin operations in Guadeloupe until proper authorization is obtained.
