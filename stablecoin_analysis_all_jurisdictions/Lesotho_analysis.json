This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Lesotho\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-02-06T00:00:40.002721\n\n## Executive Summary\nCRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no documented policies addressing stablecoin regulation in Lesotho, representing a complete compliance gap across all essential regulatory domains. This situation poses severe legal, operational, and reputational risks. Immediate action is required to: 1) Conduct comprehensive regulatory research on Lesotho's specific requirements, 2) Develop foundational policies for licensing, reserves, and AML/CTF compliance, and 3) Engage with Lesotho regulators before commencing any operations. The company should not proceed with stablecoin activities in Lesotho until these critical gaps are addressed and appropriate regulatory approvals are obtained.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Legal authorization and licensing for stablecoin issuance and operations in Lesotho\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy exists\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing the legal framework for stablecoin operations in Lesotho. No licensing procedures, authorization requirements, or regulatory engagement protocols are established.\n\n**Impact:** Operating without proper authorization could result in regulatory enforcement actions, fines, license revocation, criminal liability, and reputational damage.\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Conduct comprehensive legal research on Lesotho's financial regulations, specifically focusing on digital assets, electronic money, and payment systems. 2. Engage with the Central Bank of Lesotho to clarify regulatory expectations. 3. Develop a licensing strategy document and application procedures. 4. Create a regulatory engagement policy for ongoing compliance.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Reserve requirements and asset backing for stablecoins\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy exists\n\n**Gap:** No policies governing the composition, custody, auditing, or transparency of reserve assets backing stablecoins. No procedures for maintaining adequate reserves or regular reporting.\n\n**Impact:** Failure to maintain adequate reserves could lead to loss of peg, consumer losses, regulatory sanctions, loss of trust, and potential systemic risk to the financial system.\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Develop a comprehensive reserve management policy specifying eligible assets, custody arrangements, and segregation requirements. 2. Establish regular third-party audit procedures. 3. Create public disclosure protocols for reserve composition and amounts. 4.
