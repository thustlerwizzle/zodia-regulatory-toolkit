# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-06T08:57:05.761856

## Executive Summary
Overall compliance status is severely deficient. Based on the Cayman Islands regulatory framework for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), which encompasses stablecoin issuers, the company currently has no documented policies addressing any of the core regulatory requirements. This represents a critical level of non-compliance, exposing the company to immediate and severe regulatory enforcement risks, operational failures, and significant legal and reputational harm. Urgent and comprehensive action is required to develop and implement a full suite of policies before commencing or continuing any stablecoin issuance activities. The priority must be to secure legal advice on the precise licensing requirements and to immediately begin building the foundational AML/CFT and governance frameworks.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuer licensing/registration with Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (CIMA)

**Current Status:** No documented policy for CIMA registration or licensing

**Gap:** Company lacks policies addressing the requirement to obtain proper authorization from CIMA to issue stablecoins in or from the Cayman Islands. The Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) regime likely applies.

**Impact:** Operating without a required license could result in enforcement actions, fines, business cessation orders, and reputational damage.

**Recommendation:** 1. Immediately engage Cayman Islands legal counsel to confirm specific licensing requirements under the VASP Act. 2. Develop and implement a Licensing Policy outlining the application process, responsible personnel, and timelines. 3. Suspend any issuance activity until regulatory status is clarified.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Implementation of Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) program aligned with Cayman Islands Proceeds of Crime Act and VASP regulations.

**Current Status:** No AML/CFT policy documented.

**Gap:** Complete absence of a formal, risk-based AML/CFT program, including Customer Due Diligence (CDD), transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and record-keeping procedures as mandated for VASPs.

**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, including significant fines and loss of license. Increased risk of facilitating financial crime, leading to legal liability and catastrophic reputational harm.

**Recommendation:** 1. Draft and implement a comprehensive AML/CFT Policy and Procedures manual. 2. Appoint a qualified Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO). 3. Integrate with a transaction monitoring system and establish processes for filing reports with the Cayman Islands Financial Reporting Authority.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Maintenance of robust reserves for stablecoin issuance (full backing or other approved model) with regular independent attestation/audit.

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop a Reserve Management Policy detailing eligible assets, custody arrangements, and rebalancing procedures. 2. Establish a policy for engaging an independent, reputable auditor to perform monthly/quarterly attestations on reserve adequacy. 3. Define clear disclosure requirements for reserve composition.

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Clear consumer disclosures regarding stablecoin operation, risks, redemption rights, and reserve details.

**Recommendation:** 1. Create a Consumer Disclosure Policy that mandates specific information be provided on the company website, in terms of service, and at point of acquisition. 2. Ensure disclosures are clear, fair, and not misleading. 3. Include warnings about risks distinct from fiat currency.

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Governance and risk management framework specific to stablecoin operations.

**Recommendation:** 1. Establish a Stablecoin Governance Charter defining committee oversight and management responsibilities. 2. Develop a Stablecoin-Specific Risk Management Framework identifying, assessing, and mitigating key risks. 3. Implement regular reporting to the Board on stablecoin metrics and risk exposures.

### Gap 4: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Cybersecurity and operational resilience measures to protect stablecoin systems and user funds.

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop a Digital Asset Cybersecurity Policy covering key/custody management, smart contract security audits, penetration testing, and incident response. 2. Create a Business Continuity/Disaster Recovery Plan focused on maintaining redemption capabilities under stress.
