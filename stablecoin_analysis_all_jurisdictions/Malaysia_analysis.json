All seven critical regulatory areas show 'not met' compliance status, indicating severe regulatory risk. The most critical gaps involve operating without proper authorization, lacking reserve backing, and missing AML/CFT controls—any of which could result in immediate enforcement actions. The company must immediately suspend any stablecoin-related activities and implement a comprehensive compliance program starting with licensing authorization, followed by reserve management and AML frameworks. Given Malaysia's evolving digital asset regulatory landscape, engagement with Bank Negara Malaysia for regulatory guidance is strongly recommended before proceeding with any stablecoin initiatives."

All seven critical regulatory areas show 'not met' compliance status, indicating severe regulatory risk. The most critical gaps involve operating without proper authorization, lacking reserve backing, and missing AML/CFT controls—any of which could result in immediate enforcement actions. The company must immediately suspend any stablecoin-related activities and implement a comprehensive compliance program starting with licensing authorization, followed by reserve management and AML frameworks. Given Malaysia's evolving digital asset regulatory landscape, engagement with Bank Negara Malaysia for regulatory guidance is strongly recommended before proceeding with any stablecoin initiatives.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Authorization/Licensing: Issuance of stablecoins in Malaysia requires authorization from Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) under the Financial Services Act 2013 or Islamic Financial Services Act 2013, or registration as a recognized market operator under the Capital Markets and Services Act 2007.\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy on regulatory licensing or authorization requirements for stablecoin issuance.\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policy addressing the fundamental requirement to obtain proper authorization from BNM or Securities Commission Malaysia before issuing stablecoins.\n\n**Impact:** Operating without proper authorization constitutes illegal financial activity, potentially resulting in enforcement actions, fines, license revocation, criminal charges, and reputational damage.\n\n**Recommendation:** Immediately suspend any stablecoin issuance activities. Develop and implement a Regulatory Licensing Policy that outlines the process for obtaining necessary approvals from BNM/SC, including application procedures, documentation requirements, and ongoing compliance monitoring.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Reserve Requirements: Stablecoin issuers must maintain adequate reserves (typically 1:1) in high-quality liquid assets, with regular independent audits and transparent reporting to regulators and the public.\n\n**Current Status:** No policy governing reserve management, custody, auditing, or disclosure.\n\n**Gap:** No framework exists for managing the backing assets that ensure stablecoin value stability, creating significant risk of insolvency and loss of consumer confidence.\n\n**Impact:** Failure to maintain adequate reserves could lead to stablecoin depegging, consumer losses, regulatory enforcement, and systemic risk to the financial system.\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop a Comprehensive Reserve Management Policy detailing: 1) Eligible asset types (cash, government securities), 2) Custody arrangements with regulated custodians, 3) Monthly independent audit requirements, 4) Public disclosure of reserve composition and amounts, 5) Liquidity management procedures.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering/Combating Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT): Compliance with AML/CFT regulations under the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001, including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious transaction reporting.\n\n**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT policy specific to stablecoin operations.\n\n**Gap:** Lack of procedures for customer identification, risk assessment, transaction monitoring, or reporting suspicious activities related to stablecoin transactions.\n\n**Impact:** Exposure to regulatory penalties, enforcement actions, loss of banking relationships, and facilitation of illicit financial activities.\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement a Stablecoin-Specific AML/CFT Policy incorporating: 1) Risk-based customer due diligence (CDD) and enhanced due diligence (EDD) for high-risk customers, 2) Transaction monitoring systems for unusual patterns, 3) Procedures for filing suspicious transaction reports (STRs) to Bank Negara Malaysia, 4) Regular AML training for staff.\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer Protection: Clear disclosure of terms, risks, redemption rights, and fees. Mechanisms for handling consumer complaints and disputes.\n\n**Recommendation:** Create a Consumer Protection Framework including: 1) Standardized risk disclosure documents, 2) Clear redemption policy with timelines, 3) Transparent fee schedule, 4) Formal complaint handling procedure with escalation paths, 5) User education materials.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Governance & Risk Management: Robust governance framework with clear accountability, comprehensive risk management policies, and board oversight of stablecoin operations.\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish a Stablecoin Governance Policy defining: 1) Board committee oversight responsibilities, 2) Clear roles for compliance, risk, and operations teams, 3) Risk appetite statement specific to stablecoin operations, 4) Regular risk assessment and reporting procedures.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-006\n**Requirement:** Technology & Cybersecurity: Secure technology infrastructure, cybersecurity measures, and business continuity plans to protect against operational failures and cyber threats.\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop a Stablecoin Technology Security Policy covering: 1) Smart contract security audits and testing, 2) Cryptographic key management and custody solutions, 3) Cybersecurity controls and penetration testing, 4) Business continuity and disaster recovery plans, 5) Incident response procedures.\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **licensing_authorization**: not_met\n❌ **reserve_requirements**: not_met\n❌ **aml_cft_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **consumer_protection**: not_met\n❌ **governance_risk_management**: not_met\n❌ **technology_cybersecurity**: not_met\n❌ **reporting_disclosure**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update Summary\nGenerated: 2026-02-06T00:42:23.385716\n\n## Overview\nThis document summarizes proposed updates to company policies and standards based on regulatory gap analysis.\n\n## New Policies Required\n\n## Modified Policies\n\n### GAP-001\n**Category:** Compliance\n**Current Policy:** No documented policy on regulatory licensing or authorization requirements for stablecoin issuance.\n**Proposed Change:** Immediately suspend any stablecoin issuance activities.
