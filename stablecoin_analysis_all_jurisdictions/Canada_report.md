# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T20:17:29.607577

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits significant regulatory compliance gaps across all major areas of stablecoin regulation in Canada. The absence of documented policies indicates a foundational lack of compliance infrastructure. Critical gaps exist in MSB registration and AML/CFT requirements, which carry severe legal and operational consequences. Immediate action is required to establish basic compliance frameworks, particularly for FINTRAC registration and AML controls. The company should prioritize building a comprehensive compliance program before engaging in stablecoin operations in Canada to avoid regulatory enforcement actions and legal liabilities.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Registration as a money services business (MSB) with FINTRAC for stablecoin issuers and exchanges

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** Company lacks policies addressing MSB registration requirements under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act

**Impact:** Legal penalties including fines up to $2M, criminal charges, and inability to operate legally in Canada

**Recommendation:** Immediately assess MSB registration requirements based on business activities and implement registration process

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Implementation of comprehensive AML/CFT program including KYC, transaction monitoring, and reporting

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT program

**Gap:** Complete absence of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls required for MSBs

**Impact:** Regulatory enforcement actions, loss of banking relationships, reputational damage, and potential criminal liability

**Recommendation:** Develop and implement a full AML/CFT program including risk assessment, KYC procedures, ongoing monitoring, and reporting protocols

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Compliance with provincial securities laws for stablecoins potentially classified as securities

**Recommendation:** Conduct legal analysis of stablecoin classification and implement appropriate securities compliance measures if required

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including disclosure requirements and complaint handling

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive consumer protection framework including clear disclosures, terms of service, and complaint handling procedures

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity requirements for financial service providers

**Recommendation:** Implement cybersecurity framework, incident response plan, and business continuity procedures
