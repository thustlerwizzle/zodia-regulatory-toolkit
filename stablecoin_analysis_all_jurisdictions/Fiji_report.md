# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T22:46:34.989861

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits a complete absence of documented policies for stablecoin operations in Fiji, representing a critical compliance failure across all regulatory domains. Immediate action is required to address fundamental gaps in licensing, AML/CTF, reserve management, and consumer protection before any operational activities can commence. The current state poses severe legal, financial, and reputational risks. A phased compliance program should begin with legal authorization and AML framework development as immediate priorities, followed by operational and consumer protection policies.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Legal authorization/licensing for stablecoin issuance and operation in Fiji

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing the legal framework for operating stablecoin services in Fiji. No licensing procedures, regulatory engagement protocols, or legal authorization requirements documented.

**Impact:** Operating without proper authorization could result in regulatory enforcement actions, fines, license revocation, criminal liability, and reputational damage.

**Recommendation:** Immediately engage Fijian legal counsel to determine applicable regulations under the Reserve Bank of Fiji Act, Financial Transactions Reporting Act, and any emerging digital asset frameworks. Develop a licensing strategy and establish policies for regulatory engagement.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance for digital assets

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** No AML/CTF policies specific to stablecoin operations. Missing customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and record-keeping procedures required under Fijian law.

**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties, loss of banking relationships, potential criminal prosecution for money laundering violations, and inclusion on international watchlists.

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive AML/CTF program aligned with Fiji's Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) requirements, including KYC procedures, transaction monitoring systems, and suspicious activity reporting protocols.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Reserve management and redemption guarantee requirements for stablecoins

**Recommendation:** Establish reserve management policy specifying asset types (cash, cash equivalents, government securities), custody arrangements with regulated institutions, regular third-party audits, and transparent redemption procedures.

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive consumer protection framework including clear terms of service, risk disclosures, fee transparency, complaint handling procedures, and dispute resolution mechanisms.

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Cybersecurity and operational resilience requirements

**Recommendation:** Implement robust cybersecurity framework including multi-signature wallet controls, cold storage policies, regular security audits, incident response plan, and business continuity procedures.
