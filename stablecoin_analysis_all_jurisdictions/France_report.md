## Regulatory Requirements Summary

### **Summary of Regulatory Research Findings: Cryptocurrency & Digital Assets**

**1. Key Regulatory Requirements**
- **Stablecoin Oversight:** Programs must integrate robust Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Know Your Customer (KYC), and transaction monitoring systems. Issuers are expected to maintain reserves, ensure redemption stability, and provide transparency.
- **Monetary Sovereignty Safeguards:** Regulators, particularly central banks, emphasize frameworks to prevent digital assets from undermining national currency control, capital flow management, and monetary policy.
- **Enterprise-Grade Compliance:** Solutions for institutional adoption (e.g., wallets, on/off-ramps, payment cards) must embed compliance-by-design, aligning with financial services regulations for security and consumer protection.

**2. Compliance Obligations**
- **Risk-Based Onboarding:** Mandatory customer due diligence (CDD) and enhanced due diligence (EDD) for high-risk users, powered increasingly by AI-driven screening and monitoring tools.
- **Transaction Monitoring:** Real-time surveillance of stablecoin transactions for suspicious activity, with reporting obligations to Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs).
- **Partnership Diligence:** Firms (e.g., Dotfile & Bastion) must ensure their integrated compliance stacks meet regulatory standards across all operational jurisdictions.

**3. Recent Regulatory Changes & Trends**
- **Shift in Perception:** Acknowledgment at forums like Davos 2026 that crypto is moving beyond its "illicit money" stigma, prompting more nuanced, activity-based regulation rather than blanket restrictions.
- **Focus on Stablecoins:** Accelerated regulatory clarity for stablecoins globally, treating them as payment systems or e-money, with strict operational and reserve requirements.
- **Cross-Border Coordination:** Increased dialogue among international regulators (e.g., BIS, FSB, IMF) on harmonizing rules to address gaps and prevent regulatory arbitrage.

**4. Jurisdiction-Specific Requirements**
- **United States:** Stablecoin issuers likely subject to state money transmitter licenses, federal AML rules (Bank Secrecy Act), and potential federal legislation for payment stablecoins. SEC may assert securities law over certain programs.
- **European Union:** Compliance with Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), which imposes strict reserve, governance, and licensing requirements for stablecoin issuers.
- **Other Major Jurisdictions:** UK, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Japan are implementing bespoke regimes for stablecoins, often requiring licensing, audits, and adherence to AML/CFT directives.

**5. Enforcement Actions & Guidance**
- **Enforcement Priority:** Regulatory actions focus on unlicensed stablecoin issuance, inadequate AML controls, and deceptive reserve claims. Recent years show increased penalties for compliance failures.
- **Guidance from Davos 2026:** Central bankers signaled that while crypto's role is evolving, regulations will prioritize protecting monetary sovereignty. This may lead to stricter controls on large-scale stablecoin adoption and interoperability with traditional finance.
- **Industry-Led Solutions:** Partnerships like Dotfile-Bastion reflect proactive compliance adoption, anticipating stricter enforcement. Regulators may look favorably on such integrated risk management systems.

# Gap Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: No company policies were provided for analysis, indicating either complete absence of documented compliance programs or failure to submit existing policies. All regulatory requirements are currently NOT MET. The company faces severe regulatory risks including enforcement actions, penalties, license denials, and potential criminal liability. Immediate action is required to develop comprehensive compliance frameworks before engaging in cryptocurrency or digital asset operations. Priority should be given to AML/KYC programs, transaction monitoring, and jurisdiction-specific licensing requirements. The company should consider engaging specialized legal and compliance consultants to address these foundational gaps.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Stablecoin oversight requiring robust AML, KYC, transaction monitoring systems, reserve maintenance, redemption stability, and transparency

**Current Status:** No company policies provided for analysis

**Gap:** Complete absence of documented policies for stablecoin operations, AML/KYC programs, transaction monitoring, reserve management, or transparency disclosures

**Impact:** Severe regulatory enforcement risk including penalties, license revocation, and criminal liability for money laundering violations; inability to operate legally in regulated jurisdictions

**Recommendation:** Immediately develop comprehensive stablecoin policy framework covering: 1) AML/KYC program with risk-based approach, 2) Transaction monitoring system specifications, 3) Reserve management and audit procedures, 4) Redemption process and stability mechanisms, 5) Transparency reporting requirements

### Gap 2: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Enterprise-grade compliance with compliance-by-design for institutional solutions (wallets, on/off-ramps, payment cards)

**Current Status:** No company policies provided for analysis

**Gap:** No documented compliance-by-design principles, security standards, or consumer protection frameworks for institutional products

**Impact:** Inability to serve institutional clients; failure to meet financial services regulations; security vulnerabilities leading to breaches and liability

**Recommendation:** Implement compliance-by-design methodology across product development lifecycle; establish security standards aligned with financial services regulations; create institutional client onboarding and servicing protocols

### Gap 3: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Risk-based onboarding with mandatory CDD and EDD for high-risk users, using AI-driven screening tools

**Current Status:** No company policies provided for analysis

**Gap:** No customer due diligence program, risk assessment methodology, enhanced due diligence procedures, or automated screening capabilities

**Impact:** Direct violation of AML regulations globally; high risk of facilitating illicit finance; severe penalties and reputational damage

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive CDD/EDD program with risk-based approach; implement AI-driven screening tools for sanctions, PEPs, and adverse media; establish ongoing monitoring procedures

### Gap 4: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Transaction monitoring with real-time surveillance and FIU reporting obligations

**Current Status:** No company policies provided for analysis

**Gap:** No transaction monitoring system, suspicious activity detection processes, or FIU reporting procedures

**Impact:** Failure to detect and report suspicious transactions as required by law; criminal liability for money laundering offenses; regulatory sanctions

**Recommendation:** Implement real-time transaction monitoring system with scenario-based detection; establish SAR/STR filing procedures; train staff on reporting obligations

### Gap 5: GAP-007
**Requirement:** Jurisdiction-specific compliance (US: money transmitter licenses, BSA; EU: MiCA; other major jurisdictions)

**Current Status:** No company policies provided for analysis

**Gap:** No jurisdiction-specific compliance programs, licensing strategies, or regulatory mapping for operational markets

**Impact:** Operating without required licenses; violating local regulations; enforcement actions and market exit requirements

**Recommendation:** Conduct jurisdictional analysis for all operational markets; develop market-specific compliance programs; obtain necessary licenses before operations

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Monetary sovereignty safeguards to prevent digital assets from undermining national currency control and monetary policy

**Recommendation:** Develop monetary sovereignty impact assessment framework; establish protocols for engagement with central banks; implement controls for capital flow management compliance

### Gap 2: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Partnership diligence ensuring integrated compliance stacks meet regulatory standards across jurisdictions

**Recommendation:** Establish third-party risk management framework with compliance diligence requirements; implement ongoing monitoring of partners; create contractual compliance obligations
