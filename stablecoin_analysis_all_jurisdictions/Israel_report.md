# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-31T05:49:21.766833

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits complete non-compliance with Israeli stablecoin regulatory requirements. No documented policies exist to address any of the core regulatory obligations. This represents an extreme compliance risk that requires immediate and comprehensive remediation. The company should cease any stablecoin-related operations until foundational compliance frameworks are established and engage with Israeli regulators to understand specific requirements. Priority should be given to authorization/licensing, reserve management, and AML/CTF compliance, as these represent the most critical regulatory expectations with the highest potential impact if unaddressed.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Authorization/Licensing for stablecoin issuance in Israel

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** Company lacks any documented policy addressing the regulatory requirement for obtaining proper authorization or licensing to issue stablecoins in Israel. The Bank of Israel has indicated stablecoins fall under payment service regulation.

**Impact:** Operating without proper authorization could result in regulatory enforcement actions, fines, cease-and-desist orders, and reputational damage.

**Recommendation:** Immediately establish a policy requiring regulatory authorization assessment before any stablecoin issuance. Engage with Bank of Israel's Payment Systems Division to understand licensing requirements.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Reserve requirements and asset backing for stablecoins

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** No policy exists regarding reserve composition, custody, auditing, or transparency for stablecoin backing assets. Israeli regulators expect stablecoins to be fully backed by high-quality liquid assets.

**Impact:** Failure to maintain adequate reserves could lead to loss of peg, consumer harm, regulatory intervention, and potential insolvency proceedings.

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive reserve management policy including: 1) Asset composition requirements, 2) Segregated custody arrangements, 3) Regular third-party audits, 4) Public disclosure of reserve composition.

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** No specific AML/CTF policy for stablecoin operations. Israel's AML regulations apply to virtual asset service providers, requiring KYC, transaction monitoring, and reporting obligations.

**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties, potential criminal liability, loss of banking relationships, and inclusion on regulatory watchlists.

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive AML/CTF program including: 1) Customer identification and verification procedures, 2) Transaction monitoring systems, 3) Suspicious activity reporting protocols, 4) Designated compliance officer.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements

**Recommendation:** Create consumer protection policy covering: 1) Clear risk disclosures, 2) Redemption rights and procedures, 3) Complaint resolution mechanisms, 4) Privacy and data protection measures.

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity

**Recommendation:** Develop operational risk framework including: 1) Smart contract security and auditing procedures, 2) Key management and access controls, 3) Incident response plan, 4) Business continuity planning.
