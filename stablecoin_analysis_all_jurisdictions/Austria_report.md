# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T06:00:53.400593

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits a complete absence of documented policies and procedures necessary for compliant stablecoin operations in Austria. All critical regulatory requirements under Austrian FMA oversight and EU MiCA regulation are unmet. The current state represents significant regulatory risk, with immediate action required to develop foundational compliance frameworks before any operational activities can proceed. Priority should be given to establishing basic governance, AML/CTF controls, and engagement with regulators to understand authorization requirements. The company is currently non-compliant with all material regulatory obligations and should not engage in stablecoin issuance activities until these gaps are addressed.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Authorization requirement for issuing stablecoins under Austrian Financial Market Authority (FMA) oversight

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** Company lacks any documented policy or procedure for obtaining necessary authorization to issue stablecoins in Austria. No evidence of engagement with FMA or understanding of licensing requirements.

**Impact:** Operating without proper authorization could result in enforcement actions, fines, license revocation, and reputational damage. May constitute illegal financial activity.

**Recommendation:** Immediately suspend any stablecoin issuance activities in Austria until proper authorization is obtained. Develop a comprehensive licensing strategy document outlining steps to engage with FMA, application requirements, and compliance framework.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Capital requirements and reserve backing for stablecoin issuers as per EU Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** No policies exist regarding capital adequacy, reserve management, or asset backing for stablecoins. No documentation of reserve composition, custody arrangements, or audit procedures.

**Impact:** Failure to maintain adequate reserves could lead to insolvency, loss of peg, consumer harm, and regulatory sanctions. Violation of MiCA requirements could result in significant penalties.

**Recommendation:** Develop and implement a comprehensive reserve management policy specifying: 1) Minimum capital requirements, 2) Acceptable reserve assets and their composition, 3) Custody arrangements with regulated entities, 4) Regular independent audits, 5) Liquidity management procedures.

### Gap 3: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance under Austrian Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and EU AMLD6

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** Complete absence of AML/CTF policies, procedures, or controls. No evidence of customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, or employee training programs.

**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, potential criminal liability for management, loss of banking relationships, and inclusion in enforcement actions. Could trigger immediate supervisory intervention.

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive AML/CTF program including: 1) Customer identification and verification procedures (KYC), 2) Risk-based transaction monitoring system, 3) Suspicious activity reporting procedures to Austrian FIU, 4) Regular employee training, 5) Appointment of AML compliance officer, 6) Record-keeping policies.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including redemption rights, disclosures, and complaint handling

**Recommendation:** Create consumer protection framework including: 1) Clear redemption policy with timelines and procedures, 2) Comprehensive fee disclosure documents, 3) Complaint handling procedures with escalation paths, 4) User agreements compliant with Austrian consumer law, 5) Risk disclosure statements.

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity requirements for financial service providers

**Recommendation:** Develop operational resilience framework including: 1) Cybersecurity policy with technical controls, 2) Business continuity and disaster recovery plans, 3) Incident response procedures, 4) Third-party risk management for service providers, 5) Regular security testing and audits.

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Governance and risk management framework requirements for financial institutions

**Recommendation:** Establish formal governance framework including: 1) Clear organizational structure with defined roles and responsibilities, 2) Independent compliance function, 3) Risk management committee, 4) Internal audit function, 5) Whistleblower protection program, 6) Regular board reporting on compliance matters.
