# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-07T10:23:17.875530

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits critical compliance deficiencies with Gibraltar's stablecoin regulations. No policies currently address core regulatory requirements including licensing, reserve management, AML compliance, or consumer protection. Immediate action is required to develop comprehensive policies and initiate the DLT licensing process. The current state represents high regulatory risk and potential enforcement action if operations continue without addressing these fundamental gaps.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (GFSC) requires stablecoin issuers to obtain a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) Provider license under the Financial Services (Distributed Ledger Technology Providers) Regulations 2020

**Current Status:** No documented policy or license application process

**Gap:** Company lacks any policy addressing Gibraltar's DLT licensing requirements for stablecoin operations

**Impact:** Operating without required license could result in enforcement actions, fines, business suspension, and reputational damage

**Recommendation:** Immediately initiate DLT license application process with GFSC; develop licensing policy framework

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** GFSC Principles for DLT Providers require full backing of stablecoins with appropriate reserves and regular independent audits

**Current Status:** No reserve management or audit policies documented

**Gap:** Missing policies for reserve composition, custody, verification, and independent audit requirements

**Impact:** Risk of insufficient backing leading to loss of peg, regulatory sanctions, and loss of consumer confidence

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive reserve management policy including asset composition, custody arrangements, and quarterly independent audit requirements

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance under Gibraltar's AML regulations

**Current Status:** No AML/CTF policies documented

**Gap:** Missing AML program including KYC, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting

**Impact:** Severe regulatory sanctions, potential criminal liability, and loss of banking relationships

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive AML/CTF program with customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and reporting procedures

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Gibraltar's DLT regulations require robust risk management frameworks including operational, cyber, and financial risk controls

**Recommendation:** Establish comprehensive risk management framework covering operational, cyber, liquidity, and market risks with regular review cycles

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection requirements including clear disclosures, redemption policies, and complaint handling procedures

**Recommendation:** Develop consumer protection policy including clear terms of service, redemption procedures, and formal complaint handling process

### Gap 3: GAP-007
**Requirement:** Operational resilience and business continuity planning requirements

**Recommendation:** Develop operational resilience framework including business continuity plans, disaster recovery procedures, and incident response protocols
