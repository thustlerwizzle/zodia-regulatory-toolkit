# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T19:41:29.681462

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE GAPS IDENTIFIED: The company currently lacks any documented policies addressing stablecoin regulatory requirements applicable in Bulgaria. All core regulatory areas under EU MiCA framework and Bulgarian national regulations show complete non-compliance. Immediate action is required to develop comprehensive compliance programs, particularly for licensing, AML/CTF, capital requirements, and consumer protection. The company should prioritize engagement with Bulgarian Financial Supervision Commission (FSC) and National Revenue Agency to understand specific local implementation requirements while building foundational compliance frameworks aligned with EU regulations.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Authorization/Licensing for stablecoin issuance and services (EU MiCA framework applicable in Bulgaria)

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** Company lacks policies addressing licensing requirements for stablecoin issuance, custody, or exchange services under EU regulations applicable in Bulgaria

**Impact:** Potential regulatory enforcement actions, fines, business suspension, and reputational damage for operating without proper authorization

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive licensing strategy and policy framework aligned with MiCA requirements; engage with Bulgarian Financial Supervision Commission (FSC) for authorization process

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Capital and reserve requirements for stablecoin issuers (MiCA Article 31-35)

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** No policies addressing minimum capital requirements, reserve asset composition, or liquidity management for stablecoin operations

**Impact:** Inability to meet regulatory capital requirements, potential insolvency risks, and regulatory sanctions

**Recommendation:** Establish capital adequacy policy, reserve management framework, and liquidity protocols meeting MiCA's 1:1 backing requirements with high-quality liquid assets

### Gap 3: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance (Bulgarian AML Law and EU AMLD)

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** No AML/CTF program, customer due diligence procedures, transaction monitoring, or suspicious activity reporting framework

**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, criminal liability, loss of banking relationships, and potential business closure

**Recommendation:** Develop risk-based AML/CTF program including KYC procedures, transaction monitoring, and reporting mechanisms compliant with Bulgarian National Revenue Agency requirements

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure obligations (MiCA Article 36-40)

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive disclosure policy including whitepaper requirements, redemption procedures, and risk communication protocols

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Governance and risk management requirements (MiCA Article 25-30)

**Recommendation:** Establish three lines of defense model, appoint compliance officer, implement risk management framework, and create governance policies

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity (EU DORA regulation and Bulgarian cybersecurity requirements)

**Recommendation:** Develop ICT risk management framework, incident response plan, and business continuity procedures aligned with DORA requirements
