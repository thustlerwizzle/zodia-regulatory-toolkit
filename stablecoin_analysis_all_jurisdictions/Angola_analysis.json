Policy Title\nInterim Suspension and Regulatory Development Policy for Digital Payment Instruments, Including Stablecoins, in the Republic of Angola.\n\n## 2. Purpose and Scope\n\n### 2.1 Purpose\nThe purpose of this policy is to:\n*   Protect consumers, investors, and the financial stability of Angola from potential risks associated with the unregulated issuance, distribution, and use of stablecoins.\n*   Establish an immediate and orderly suspension of all stablecoin-related activities to create a controlled environment.\n*   Mandate the completion of comprehensive legal and regulatory research to inform the development of a secure, innovative, and compliant framework for digital assets.\n\n### 2.2 Scope\nThis policy applies to:\n*   **All natural and legal persons** operating within the jurisdiction of Angola.\n*   **All activities** related to the issuance, creation, distribution, exchange, transfer, storage, promotion, advertising, and facilitation of transactions involving stablecoins, regardless of the technology used (e.g., blockchain, distributed ledger).\n*   This includes, but is not limited to: financial institutions, fintech companies, technology service providers, exchanges, wallet providers, and individual promoters.\n\n## 3. Definitions\n\n*   **Digital Asset:** A digital representation of value that can be digitally traded or transferred and can be used for payment or investment purposes.\n*   **Stablecoin:** A type of digital asset designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified asset or a pool of assets (e.g., a single fiat currency like the US Dollar or the Angolan Kwanza, a commodity, or a basket of currencies).\n*   **Issuer:** Any entity that creates, originates, or has the obligation to redeem a stablecoin.\n*   **Operator:** Any entity that facilitates the transfer, exchange, storage, or administration of stablecoins for users.\n*   **Regulatory Research Phase:** The period during which the relevant authorities will conduct a comprehensive analysis of stablecoin technologies, risks, global regulatory approaches, and economic impacts to draft a permanent regulatory framework.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\n\nIn light of the absence of a specific legal and regulatory framework governing stablecoins and the associated risks to financial stability, consumer protection, and monetary sovereignty, it is the policy of the Republic of Angola to:\n\n**Immediately suspend all commercial and operational activities involving stablecoins within its jurisdiction.** No new stablecoin projects may be launched, and existing operations must cease all client-facing and market activities until a comprehensive national regulatory framework is enacted into law.\n\nThis suspension is a precautionary measure to allow for the necessary research and development of rules that ensure safety, transparency, anti-money laundering (AML) compliance, counter-financing of terrorism (CFT), market integrity, and financial stability.\n\n## 5. Procedures\n\n### 5.1 Notification and Immediate Cessation\n1.  Upon the effective date of this policy, all entities engaged in stablecoin activities must immediately:\n    *   Halt the onboarding of new users or clients.\n    *   Cease all marketing, advertising, and promotional activities.\n    *   Suspend all trading, issuance, and redemption functions accessible to the public.\n2.  Entities must publish a clear notice on their platforms and communicate directly with users regarding the suspension and the orderly winding down of services as required.\n\n### 5.2 Wind-Down and User Protection\n1.  Entities must provide a clear mechanism for existing users to redeem or withdraw any fiat currency or other assets held as backing for stablecoins, subject to applicable AML/CFT verification.\n2.  A wind-down plan must be submitted to the relevant regulatory authority within 14 days of this policy's effective date, outlining steps to protect consumers and settle obligations.\n\n### 5.3 Regulatory Research and Development Phase\n1.  The [Relevant Regulatory Body] will lead an inter-agency task force to:\n    *   Analyze technological models of stablecoins (e.g., asset-backed, algorithmic).\n    *   Study international regulatory best practices (e.g., FATF recommendations, EU's MiCA, approaches from other African nations).\n    *   Assess risks related to monetary policy, financial stability, consumer protection, data privacy, and cyber-security.\n    *   Conduct stakeholder consultations with industry, academia, and civil society.\n2.  The output of this phase will be a draft legislative proposal for a comprehensive regulatory framework.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n\n### 6.1 Mandatory Actions for Entities\n*   Full compliance with the suspension order.\n*   Submission of wind-down plans and periodic status reports.\n*   Cooperation with regulatory authorities during the research phase, including providing requested information.\n*   Maintenance of all records related to the suspended operations for audit purposes.\n\n### 6.2 Enforcement and Penalties\nNon-compliance with this interim suspension policy will result in enforcement actions, which may include:\n*   Administrative fines and penalties.\n*   Orders to cease and desist.\n*   Civil actions.\n*   Referral to law enforcement for criminal investigation where activities may constitute fraud, market manipulation, or violation of existing financial laws.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule\n\n*   This interim policy will remain in effect until superseded by formal legislation.\n*   The status of the Regulatory Research Phase will be reviewed and communicated publicly every six (6) months.\n*   This policy document itself will be reviewed annually or as needed based on developments in the digital asset landscape.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements\n\nThis policy is promulgated under the general authority granted by existing Angolan law, including but not limited to:\n*   The Constitution of the Republic of Angola.\n*   **Lei nº 12/2015, de 17 de Junho** - Lei das Instituições Financeiras (Financial Institutions Law), which establishes the regulatory perimeter for payment systems.\n*   **Lei nº 34/11, de 12 de Setembro** - Lei do Banco Nacional de Angola (Law of the National Bank of Angola), affirming its role in ensuring monetary and financial stability.\n*   **Decreto Presidencial nº 62/20, de 24 de Fevereiro** - Approving the National Strategy for Financial Inclusion, which underscores the need for safe and regulated digital payment avenues.\n*   Angola's commitments as a member of the **Financial Action Task Force (FATF)** to mitigate AML/CFT risks in virtual assets.\n*   The need to align with regional initiatives within the **Southern African Development Community (SADC)** regarding digital finance.\n\n---\n*Document End*\n```"

Policy Title\nDigital Asset Service Provider Licensing and Regulatory Engagement Policy\n\n## 2. Purpose and Scope\n### Purpose\nThis policy establishes a formal framework for identifying, obtaining, and maintaining all required licenses and authorizations for digital asset service provision from the Banco Nacional de Angola (BNA) and other relevant Angolan regulatory bodies. The policy aims to ensure full compliance with Angolan law, mitigate regulatory risk, and establish a structured approach to regulatory engagement.\n\n### Scope\nThis policy applies to all company divisions, subsidiaries, and personnel involved in or supporting the provision of digital asset services within or into the Angolan market. This includes, but is not limited to, business development, legal, compliance, technology, and finance functions.\n\n## 3.

Policy Statement\nIt is the policy of this organization to operate in full compliance with all Angolan licensing and regulatory requirements applicable to Digital Asset Service Providers. The company expressly prohibits conducting any regulated digital asset service activity in Angola without first securing the necessary formal licenses or authorizations from the BNA. To achieve this, the company will proactively engage qualified local legal experts to interpret regulatory mandates and guide a compliant market entry strategy.\n\n## 5. Procedures\nTo implement this policy, the following procedures shall be followed:\n\n**5.1. Engagement of Local Legal Counsel**\n1.

This document shall include:\n    *   A list of all required licenses and their specific application forms.\n    *   A comprehensive checklist of all documentation, policies, and internal controls required by the BNA (e.g., AML/CFT policy, cybersecurity framework, governance structure, financial statements).\n    *   A realistic timeline with key milestones for document preparation, internal reviews, pre-application engagement (if advisable), submission, and follow-up.\n    *   A RACI matrix (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) clearly defining team member responsibilities.\n    *   A plan for preparing for and managing interactions with the BNA, including potential interviews or on-site inspections.\n\n**5.3. Implementation and Application Submission**\n1.  All internal departments are required to prioritize and fulfill their responsibilities as outlined in the Licensing Application Strategy.\n2.  The Legal Department, with support from local counsel, shall be the primary point for drafting and compiling the final application package.\n3.  The CCO must provide final approval on the application package prior to submission, attesting to its completeness and accuracy.\n4.  A secure record of all application submissions, communications with the BNA, and supplemental information provided shall be maintained by the Compliance Department.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n*   **Mandatory Legal Review:** No digital asset services shall be marketed or offered to Angolan residents prior to the successful completion of the licensing process and receipt of formal authorization from the BNA.\n*   **Resource Allocation:** Senior Management must ensure adequate financial and human resources are allocated to support the licensing strategy and any required operational changes.\n*   **Full Cooperation:** All employees must cooperate fully with the project team and local legal counsel, providing accurate information and timely completion of assigned tasks related to the licensing effort.\n*   **Non-Compliance:** Failure to adhere to this policy may result in significant legal, financial, and reputational harm to the company.

The specific regulations and requirements will be identified and detailed by the engaged Local Legal Counsel. Applicable regulatory instruments may include (but are not limited to):\n*   The Angolan Financial Institutions Law.\n*   BNA regulations governing payment systems and electronic money institutions.\n*   BNA directives on the prevention of Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT).\n*   Any specific circulars or rulings issued by the BNA concerning virtual assets or digital asset services.\n```\n*Policy Version: 1.0  \nEffective Date: [Date of Approval]  \nApproved By: [Signature of CEO & Chief Compliance Officer]*"

Purpose and Scope  \n### 2.1 Purpose  \nThis policy establishes a formal framework for the management, verification, and disclosure of reserves held by the organization.

Definitions  \n- **Reserves:** The total pool of assets held to fully back all outstanding user liabilities.  \n- **1:1 Backing:** A requirement that the fair market value of reserve assets equals or exceeds the total value of user liabilities at all times.  \n- **Eligible Reserve Assets:** High-quality, highly liquid assets approved for backing user funds, as defined in Section 5.1.  \n- **Independent Auditor:** A qualified, external third-party audit firm with relevant expertise, appointed to verify reserve adequacy and custody.  \n- **User Liabilities:** The total value of user funds held by the organization, payable upon demand.  \n- **Proof of Reserves (PoR):** A cryptographic or accounting method used to demonstrate ownership of reserves and their sufficiency relative to liabilities.\n\n## 4.

Ownership and control of reserve assets.  \n  b. The accuracy of the reported user liabilities.  \n  c. The 1:1 backing calculation as of the statement date.  \n  d. The proper segregation of assets.\n\n### 5.4 Transparency Reporting  \n- **Report Publication:** A public Transparency Report, containing the audited findings, will be published within 30 days following the completion of each quarterly audit.  \n- **Content:** The report will include:  \n  a. The audit opinion from the Independent Auditor.  \n  b. The statement date and the Reserve Ratio.  \n  c. A breakdown of reserve assets by type and custodian.  \n  d. A high-level summary of the audit methodology.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements  \n- **Monitoring:** The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) is responsible for ongoing monitoring of compliance with this policy.  \n- **Policy Breach:** A breach of the 1:1 backing requirement is classified as a **Severity 1** incident. It must be reported immediately to the Executive Leadership Team and the Board Risk Committee. Corrective action (e.g., capital infusion, suspension of new liabilities) must be taken within 24 hours to restore the 100% ratio.  \n- **Non-Compliance Consequences:** Failure to adhere to this policy, including audit or reporting obligations, may result in disciplinary action, regulatory reporting obligations, and significant reputational damage.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule  \nThis policy shall be reviewed annually by the Policy Owner (CRO) and the Board Risk Committee. Updates will be made in response to:  \n- Changes in regulatory requirements.  \n- Material changes in business structure or product offerings.  \n- Findings from internal or external audits.  \nThe version history will be maintained within the document.\n\n## 8.

Purpose and Scope  \n### 2.1 Purpose  \nThis policy establishes a formal framework for the management, verification, and disclosure of reserves held by the organization. Its primary objectives are to:  \n- Ensure all user funds are backed 1:1 by equivalent high-quality reserve assets.  \n- Mitigate counterparty, liquidity, and solvency risks.  \n- Provide stakeholders with reliable, transparent information through regular independent audits and public reporting.  \n- Ensure compliance with applicable regulatory standards for reserve management and custody.\n\n### 2.2 Scope  \nThis policy applies to all reserves held for the benefit of users or clients, encompassing all digital and fiat currency balances for which the organization acts as a custodian or issuer. It mandates the responsibilities of the Treasury, Finance, Risk, and Compliance departments.\n\n## 3. Definitions  \n- **Reserves:** The total pool of assets held to fully back all outstanding user liabilities.  \n- **1:1 Backing:** A requirement that the fair market value of reserve assets equals or exceeds the total value of user liabilities at all times.  \n- **Eligible Reserve Assets:** High-quality, highly liquid assets approved for backing user funds, as defined in Section 5.1.  \n- **Independent Auditor:** A qualified, external third-party audit firm with relevant expertise, appointed to verify reserve adequacy and custody.  \n- **User Liabilities:** The total value of user funds held by the organization, payable upon demand.  \n- **Proof of Reserves (PoR):** A cryptographic or accounting method used to demonstrate ownership of reserves and their sufficiency relative to liabilities.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement  \nIt is the policy of this organization to maintain at all times a 1:1 ratio between the value of user liabilities and the value of held reserve assets. Reserves shall be held in secure, segregated accounts and shall consist solely of Eligible Reserve Assets. The adequacy and custody of these reserves will be verified through regular independent audits, the results of which will be published in periodic Transparency Reports to ensure public accountability.\n\n## 5. Procedures  \n### 5.1 Reserve Composition & Custody  \n- **Eligible Assets:** Reserve assets are restricted to:  \n  a. Cash and cash equivalents (e.g., bank deposits, treasury bills).  \n  b. Direct obligations of sovereign nations with high credit ratings.  \n  c. Other highly liquid, low-risk instruments as pre-approved by the Risk Committee.  \n- **Prohibited Assets:** Under no circumstances shall user reserves be invested in speculative, illiquid, or high-risk assets (e.g., corporate debt, equities, proprietary trading).  \n- **Custody:** Assets must be held in segregated accounts under the organization's name at regulated custodians or financial institutions. Private keys for digital assets must be managed under a multi-signature or institutional-grade custody scheme.\n\n### 5.2 Reserve Adequacy Verification  \n- **Daily Reconciliation:** The Treasury Department must perform a daily reconciliation comparing the total value of user liabilities to the total market value of reserve assets.  \n- **Formal Calculation:** A formal Reserve Ratio calculation will be performed at the close of business each Friday. The minimum acceptable ratio is 100%.  \n- **Breach Protocol:** Any calculation indicating a ratio below 100% constitutes a Policy Breach and must trigger the incident response protocol outlined in Section 6.\n\n### 5.3 Independent Audits  \n- **Frequency:** A full-scope independent audit of reserves will be conducted at least **quarterly**.  \n- **Auditor Selection:** The Audit Committee will select and appoint the Independent Auditor, ensuring no conflict of interest exists.  \n- **Audit Scope:** The audit must, at a minimum, verify:  \n  a. Ownership and control of reserve assets.  \n  b. The accuracy of the reported user liabilities.  \n  c. The 1:1 backing calculation as of the statement date.  \n  d. The proper segregation of assets.\n\n### 5.4 Transparency Reporting  \n- **Report Publication:** A public Transparency Report, containing the audited findings, will be published within 30 days following the completion of each quarterly audit.  \n- **Content:** The report will include:  \n  a. The audit opinion from the Independent Auditor.  \n  b. The statement date and the Reserve Ratio.  \n  c. A breakdown of reserve assets by type and custodian.  \n  d. A high-level summary of the audit methodology.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements  \n- **Monitoring:** The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) is responsible for ongoing monitoring of compliance with this policy.  \n- **Policy Breach:** A breach of the 1:1 backing requirement is classified as a **Severity 1** incident. It must be reported immediately to the Executive Leadership Team and the Board Risk Committee. Corrective action (e.g., capital infusion, suspension of new liabilities) must be taken within 24 hours to restore the 100% ratio.  \n- **Non-Compliance Consequences:** Failure to adhere to this policy, including audit or reporting obligations, may result in disciplinary action, regulatory reporting obligations, and significant reputational damage.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule  \nThis policy shall be reviewed annually by the Policy Owner (CRO) and the Board Risk Committee. Updates will be made in response to:  \n- Changes in regulatory requirements.  \n- Material changes in business structure or product offerings.  \n- Findings from internal or external audits.  \nThe version history will be maintained within the document.\n\n## 8.

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Angola\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-01-30T05:27:07.971495\n\n## Executive Summary\nCRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no documented policies addressing stablecoin regulation in Angola, representing a complete regulatory gap. All essential regulatory requirements are unmet, creating severe legal, financial, and operational risks. Immediate action is required to: 1) Suspend operations until regulatory research is complete, 2) Engage local legal counsel, 3) Develop comprehensive compliance framework. The company is currently non-compliant with Angolan financial regulations and cannot legally operate stablecoin services in the jurisdiction.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Legal framework for stablecoin issuance and operation in Angola\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policies found\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing stablecoin operations, issuance, redemption, or reserve management in Angola\n\n**Impact:** Company cannot legally operate stablecoin services in Angola; risk of regulatory enforcement, fines, and business shutdown\n\n**Recommendation:** Immediately suspend stablecoin operations in Angola until comprehensive regulatory research is completed and compliant policies are developed\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Licensing requirements for digital asset service providers\n\n**Current Status:** No licensing or authorization policies documented\n\n**Gap:** No policies addressing licensing requirements, application processes, or ongoing compliance with Angolan financial regulatory bodies\n\n**Impact:** Operating without required licenses exposes company to criminal liability, asset seizure, and permanent market exclusion\n\n**Recommendation:** Engage local legal counsel to identify specific licensing requirements from Banco Nacional de Angola and develop licensing application strategy\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance\n\n**Current Status:** No AML/CTF policies specific to Angola\n\n**Gap:** Lack of policies addressing Angola's specific AML/CTF requirements, customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and reporting obligations\n\n**Impact:** Significant financial crime risks, regulatory penalties, and potential criminal prosecution of company officers\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop Angola-specific AML/CTF program aligned with Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards and local regulations\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements\n\n**Recommendation:** Create comprehensive consumer protection framework including clear disclosures, risk warnings, and complaint resolution procedures\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Reserve management and auditing requirements\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement robust reserve management policy with 1:1 backing, regular independent audits, and public transparency reports\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-006\n**Requirement:** Data protection and privacy compliance\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop data protection policy compliant with Angola's Lei de Proteção de Dados Pessoais and establish data processing agreements\n\n### Gap 4: GAP-008\n**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive operational risk management framework including cybersecurity controls and incident response plans\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **stablecoin_issuance_framework**: not_met\n❌ **licensing_requirements**: not_met\n❌ **aml_ctf_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **consumer_protection**: not_met\n❌ **reserve_management**: not_met\n❌ **data_protection**: not_met\n❌ **tax_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **operational_risk_management**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update Summary\nGenerated:
