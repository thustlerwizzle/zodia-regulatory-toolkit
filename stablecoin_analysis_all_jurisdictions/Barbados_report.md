# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T18:39:22.681260

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently operates with no documented policies addressing Barbados stablecoin regulatory requirements. All core regulatory areas show complete non-compliance, creating severe legal, operational, and reputational risks. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive compliance framework before commencing operations. Priority should be given to licensing, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance, as these represent the most immediate regulatory enforcement risks. The company should engage local Barbados legal counsel and compliance experts to ensure proper interpretation and implementation of regulatory requirements.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must maintain full backing reserves in high-quality liquid assets (Barbados regulatory framework for digital assets)

**Current Status:** No documented policy on reserve management or asset backing

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies governing reserve composition, custody, verification, or reporting

**Impact:** Regulatory enforcement action, license revocation, loss of customer trust, potential insolvency risk

**Recommendation:** Develop and implement a comprehensive Reserve Management Policy specifying: 1) Eligible asset classes, 2) Minimum liquidity requirements, 3) Custody arrangements with qualified custodians, 4) Monthly independent attestation/audit requirements, 5) Public disclosure framework

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Mandatory licensing/registration with Barbados Financial Services Commission (FSC) for digital asset businesses

**Current Status:** No documented licensing strategy or compliance framework

**Gap:** No policies addressing regulatory registration, ongoing reporting, or supervisory engagement

**Impact:** Operating illegally, severe penalties including fines and criminal liability, inability to access banking services

**Recommendation:** Immediately develop Regulatory Engagement Policy including: 1) License application roadmap, 2) Designated compliance officer role, 3) Regulatory reporting calendar, 4) FSC communication protocols, 5) Change-in-control notification procedures

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting (Barbados AML Act and FSC guidelines)

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT program

**Gap:** Complete absence of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls

**Impact:** Regulatory sanctions, financial penalties, reputational damage, potential criminal liability for directors

**Recommendation:** Establish comprehensive AML/CFT Program including: 1) Risk-based customer identification and verification, 2) Ongoing transaction monitoring system, 3) Suspicious activity reporting procedures, 4) Designated AML compliance officer, 5) Regular employee training

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection requirements including clear disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling (Barbados consumer financial protection regulations)

**Recommendation:** Develop Consumer Protection Framework covering: 1) Clear terms of service and risk disclosures, 2) Transparent fee structure, 3) Redemption procedures and timelines, 4) Formal complaint handling process, 5) Dispute resolution mechanism

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Cybersecurity and operational resilience standards (FSC technology and operational risk guidelines)

**Recommendation:** Implement Cybersecurity Framework including: 1) Multi-signature wallet controls, 2) Regular security audits, 3) Incident response plan, 4) Business continuity and disaster recovery plan, 5) Third-party vendor risk management

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Governance and risk management framework including board oversight and independent risk function (Barbados corporate governance code for financial institutions)

**Recommendation:** Establish Governance Framework with: 1) Board risk committee charter, 2) Formal risk appetite statement, 3) Three lines of defense model, 4) Independent compliance function, 5) Regular board reporting on compliance matters
