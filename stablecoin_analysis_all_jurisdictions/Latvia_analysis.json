This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Latvia\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-01-31T11:03:21.386798\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company's current policy framework is non-existent with respect to stablecoin operations in Latvia. There is a total compliance vacuum across all critical regulatory domains: licensing, AML/CFT, prudential regulation (MiCA), cybersecurity, and consumer protection. The company is not operational in any compliant manner and faces critical, existential risks. Immediate and foundational work is required to develop a complete compliance management system before any market activity can be contemplated. The priority must be to understand the regulatory landscape, secure necessary legal advice, and build policies from the ground up.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Authorization/Licensing for stablecoin issuance and related services (e.g., custody, exchange) under Latvian and EU financial services frameworks (e.g., Electronic Money Institution (EMI), Payment Institution (PI), or Credit Institution license).\n\n**Current Status:** No policy identified. The company appears to lack any documented policy framework for stablecoin operations in Latvia.\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing the fundamental legal requirement to obtain proper authorization before operating. There is no process for license application, regulatory engagement, or compliance with capital, governance, or operational prerequisites.\n\n**Impact:** Operating without authorization constitutes illegal activity, leading to severe penalties, including fines, cessation of operations, criminal liability for management, and irreparable reputational damage.\n\n**Recommendation:** Immediately cease any operational activities in Latvia. Develop a comprehensive licensing strategy. Engage with the Latvian Financial and Capital Market Commission (FKTK) to understand specific application requirements. Create a project plan covering application preparation, governance structure, capital requirements, and IT/security audits.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Compliance with the EU Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), which will directly regulate stablecoins (asset-referenced tokens and e-money tokens). Key requirements include: robust governance, clear redemption rights, prudential safeguards (reserve assets), liquidity management, and detailed whitepapers.\n\n**Current Status:** No policy identified. No alignment with MiCA's comprehensive framework for issuance, governance, disclosure, or reserve management.\n\n**Gap:** Total lack of policies to meet the forthcoming EU-wide regulatory standard for crypto-assets. The company is unprepared for mandatory requirements on transparency, investor protection, operational resilience, and reserve backing.\n\n**Impact:** Inability to legally issue or offer stablecoins in the EU once MiCA applies (expected mid-2024 for stablecoin provisions). Risk of enforcement actions, mandatory withdrawal of tokens from the market, and loss of competitive positioning.\n\n**Recommendation:** Initiate a MiCA readiness program. Draft policies covering: 1) Token classification and whitepaper requirements, 2) Governance and conflict of interest management, 3) Reserve asset management and custody (segregation, valuation, audit), 4) Redemption policy and procedures, 5) Liquidity risk management, 6) Complaint handling and disclosure.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Adherence to Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) obligations under Latvian law and the EU's AML Directives (AMLD5/6), including customer due diligence (CDD), transaction monitoring, reporting of suspicious activities, and registration with the FKTK as a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP).\n\n**Current Status:** No policy identified. No AML/CFT program, procedures, or appointed Compliance Officer/Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO).\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of the foundational compliance program required for any financial or VASP activity. No processes for KYC, onboarding, ongoing monitoring, sanction screening, or reporting.\n\n**Impact:** High risk of facilitating financial crime. Will result in immediate regulatory intervention, significant fines, and potential loss of correspondent banking relationships. Criminal prosecution is possible.\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop and implement a full AML/CFT program immediately, including: 1) Risk assessment, 2) CDD/KYC procedures (including for PEPs), 3) Transaction monitoring rules, 4) Sanctions screening, 5) Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR) procedures, 6) Record-keeping, 7) Employee training. Appoint a qualified MLRO and register as a VASP with the FKTK.\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Implementation of robust IT security, operational resilience, and cybersecurity measures as expected by financial regulators (e.g., guidelines from the European Banking Authority - EBA, and FKTK). This includes secure custody solutions, incident response plans, and business continuity planning.\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive IT security and operational resilience policies aligned with financial industry standards (e.g., ISO 27001, NIST). Key policies must cover: 1) Digital asset custody (hot/cold wallet management, key management), 2) Cybersecurity controls, 3) Incident response and communication plan, 4) Business continuity and disaster recovery, 5) Third-party/vendor risk management.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements, including clear, fair, and not misleading marketing communications, provision of key information documents, and transparent terms & conditions for redemption and fees.\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish a marketing and communications compliance policy. Create a review and approval process for all public-facing materials. Draft standardized disclosure documents (e.g., key information sheet) detailing risks, fees, and redemption procedures as required by MiCA and local consumer law.\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **Authorization_Licensing**: not_met\n❌ **MiCA_Readiness**: not_met\n❌ **AML_CFT_Compliance**: not_met\n❌ **IT_Security_Operational_Resilience**: not_met\n❌ **Consumer_Protection_Disclosure**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update Summary\nGenerated: 2026-01-31T11:04:13.696656\n\n## Overview\nThis document summarizes proposed updates to company policies and standards based on regulatory gap analysis.\n\n## New Policies Required\n\n## Modified Policies\n\n### GAP-001\n**Category:** Compliance\n**Current Policy:** No policy identified. The company appears to lack any documented policy framework for stablecoin operations in Latvia.\n**Proposed Change:** Immediately cease any operational activities in Latvia.

Create a project plan covering application preparation, governance structure, capital requirements, and IT/security audits.\n\n### GAP-002\n**Category:** Risk Management\n**Current Policy:** No policy identified.

Appoint a qualified MLRO and register as a VASP with the FKTK.\n\n### GAP-004\n**Category:** Operational\n**Current Policy:** No policy identified. No documented security standards, incident response plans, or custody frameworks specific to digital assets.\n**Proposed Change:** Develop comprehensive IT security and operational resilience policies aligned with financial industry standards (e.g., ISO 27001, NIST). Key policies must cover: 1) Digital asset custody (hot/cold wallet management, key management), 2) Cybersecurity controls, 3) Incident response and communication plan, 4) Business continuity and disaster recovery, 5) Third-party/vendor risk management.\n\n### GAP-005\n**Category:** Data Protection\n**Current Policy:** No policy identified.
