# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T19:02:02.802374

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no documented policies addressing stablecoin regulatory requirements in Benin. This represents a complete regulatory gap with severe operational and legal risks. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive regulatory compliance framework before commencing any stablecoin operations. The highest priority gaps relate to licensing, AML/CTF compliance, and consumer protection, which are typically the focus of financial regulators in the West African region. Given the limited regulatory research results, the company must urgently conduct proper regulatory due diligence specific to Benin's implementation of WAEMU/BCEAO regulations regarding digital currencies.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Legal authorization/licensing for stablecoin issuance or service provision in Benin

**Current Status:** No documented policy found regarding licensing requirements for stablecoin operations

**Gap:** Company lacks policies addressing the need for formal authorization from Benin's financial regulators (potentially the Central Bank of West African States - BCEAO or Benin's Ministry of Finance) to issue or facilitate stablecoin transactions

**Impact:** Operating without proper authorization could result in regulatory enforcement actions, fines, business suspension, or criminal liability for company executives

**Recommendation:** Immediately engage legal counsel to research Benin's specific licensing requirements for digital currency operations and develop a licensing application strategy

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance for stablecoin transactions

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CTF policies specific to stablecoin operations

**Gap:** Company lacks policies for customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and record-keeping requirements specific to stablecoin transactions as required by West African financial regulations

**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties, loss of banking relationships, reputational damage, and potential criminal liability for AML/CTF violations

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive AML/CTF policies aligned with WAEMU/BCEAO regulations and FATF recommendations for virtual asset service providers

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements for stablecoin users

**Recommendation:** Create comprehensive consumer protection framework including clear terms of service, risk disclosures, and complaint handling procedures

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Reserve management and auditing requirements for stablecoin issuers

**Recommendation:** Establish formal reserve management policy with regular third-party audits and transparent reporting to regulators and users

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Data privacy and cybersecurity requirements for financial service providers

**Recommendation:** Develop data protection and cybersecurity policies compliant with local regulations and international financial standards
