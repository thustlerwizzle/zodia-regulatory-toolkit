Based on international regulatory trends and Turks and Caicos Islands' likely alignment with Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF) standards, all critical regulatory areas show significant gaps. The company is currently non-compliant and faces substantial regulatory, operational, and reputational risks. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive compliance framework before engaging in stablecoin operations. Priority should be given to licensing strategy, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance, as these represent the most critical regulatory requirements with the highest potential impact if unaddressed.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Legal authorization/licensing for stablecoin issuance or related financial services in Turks and Caicos Islands\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found regarding stablecoin operations in Turks and Caicos Islands\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing regulatory authorization requirements for operating in Turks and Caicos Islands jurisdiction\n\n**Impact:** Potential for operating without required licenses, leading to regulatory enforcement actions, fines, business shutdown, and reputational damage\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Conduct comprehensive regulatory research on Turks and Caicos Islands financial regulations 2. Develop licensing strategy document 3. Create policy for regulatory engagement and application processes\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Reserve requirements and asset backing for stablecoins (based on international standards)\n\n**Current Status:** No documented reserve management or asset backing policies\n\n**Gap:** Missing policies governing reserve composition, custody, auditing, and transparency for stablecoin backing assets\n\n**Impact:** Risk of insufficient backing, regulatory non-compliance, loss of customer trust, and potential insolvency events\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Develop comprehensive reserve management policy 2. Establish custody arrangements with regulated institutions 3. Implement regular independent audits 4. Create public disclosure framework\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance for virtual asset service providers\n\n**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT policies specific to stablecoin operations\n\n**Gap:** Absence of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing policies tailored to stablecoin transactions and customer onboarding\n\n**Impact:** Significant regulatory risk, potential for financial crime facilitation, severe penalties, and loss of banking relationships\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Develop comprehensive AML/CFT policy framework 2. Implement KYC/CDD procedures 3. Establish transaction monitoring system 4. Create suspicious activity reporting protocols\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Develop consumer protection policy 2. Create clear terms of service and risk disclosures 3. Establish customer complaint resolution process 4. Implement redemption policy framework\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Develop comprehensive technology risk management policy 2. Implement smart contract security protocols 3. Establish key management and custody solutions 4. Create business continuity and disaster recovery plans\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-007\n**Requirement:** Cross-border compliance and jurisdictional considerations\n\n**Recommendation:** 1.
