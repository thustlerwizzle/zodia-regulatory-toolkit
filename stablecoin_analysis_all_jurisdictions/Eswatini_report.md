## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no documented policies addressing stablecoin regulatory requirements in Eswatini. This represents a complete regulatory compliance failure with severe operational, legal, and reputational risks. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive regulatory compliance program. Priority should be given to addressing licensing requirements, reserve management, and AML/CTF compliance, as these represent the most critical regulatory obligations. The company should engage local legal counsel and regulatory experts to properly understand Eswatini's specific regulatory framework for stablecoins and digital assets.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Legal authorization/licensing for stablecoin issuance or operation

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing licensing requirements for stablecoin operations in Eswatini

**Impact:** Potential for regulatory enforcement actions, fines, or business shutdown for operating without proper authorization

**Recommendation:** 1. Conduct comprehensive regulatory research on Eswatini's financial services licensing framework

3. Develop licensing application strategy and timeline

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Reserve requirements and asset backing for stablecoins

**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, potential criminal liability, and reputational damage

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop comprehensive AML/CTF program
2. Implement customer due diligence (CDD) and know-your-customer (KYC) procedures
3. Establish transaction monitoring and suspicious activity reporting

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop consumer protection policy framework
