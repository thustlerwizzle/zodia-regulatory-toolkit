Additionally, significant gaps exist in AML, cybersecurity, and consumer protection areas that could result in regulatory sanctions, financial losses, and reputational damage. The company should prioritize developing a foundational cryptocurrency compliance framework before engaging in any cryptocurrency-related activities in El Salvador."

Purpose and Scope\n**Purpose:** This policy establishes the mandatory framework for accepting Bitcoin as legal tender in compliance with El Salvador's Bitcoin Law (Ley Bitcoin). It ensures consistent, secure, and legally compliant handling of Bitcoin transactions across all business operations.\n\n**Scope:** This policy applies to all employees, contractors, agents, and representatives of [Company Name] who are involved in sales, customer service, accounting, or any function related to the solicitation, acceptance, processing, or recording of customer payments. It covers all goods and services offered by the company within the jurisdiction of El Salvador.\n\n## 3. Definitions\n*   **Bitcoin (BTC):** A decentralized digital currency operating on a peer-to-peer network, recognized as legal tender in El Salvador.\n*   **Legal Tender:** Currency that must be accepted if offered in payment of a debt. In El Salvador, this includes both the US Dollar (USD) and Bitcoin.\n*   **Bitcoin Law (Ley Bitcoin):** The Legislative Decree No. 57, enacted on September 7, 2021, granting Bitcoin the status of legal tender in El Salvador.\n*   **Chivo Wallet:** The official digital wallet provided by the Government of El Salvador for holding and transacting in Bitcoin and US Dollars.\n*   **Approved Payment Service Provider (PSP):** A third-party system or wallet, approved by [Company Name] and compliant with national regulations, for processing Bitcoin transactions (e.g., Strike, Muun, or other regulated custodial/non-custodial wallets).\n*   **Conversion:** The immediate exchange of received Bitcoin into US Dollars at the time of transaction, facilitated by the chosen wallet or PSP.\n*   **Satoshi (sats):** The smallest unit of Bitcoin (0.00000001 BTC).\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\nIn accordance with El Salvador's Bitcoin Law, [Company Name] recognizes Bitcoin as legal tender. Therefore, the company **must** accept Bitcoin as a form of payment for all goods and services from any customer who offers it, unless a specific, documented, and verifiable technological incapacity exists. The company will facilitate this acceptance through integrated systems, clear procedures, and trained personnel to ensure seamless, secure, and compliant transactions.\n\n## 5. Procedures\n\n### 5.1. Accepting Bitcoin Payments\n1.  **Price Quotation:** All displayed prices (in-store, online, on invoices) will be denoted in US Dollars (USD). At the point of sale, the equivalent Bitcoin amount will be calculated in real-time using the exchange rate provided by the integrated wallet or PSP.\n2.  **Transaction Initiation:** The employee or point-of-sale (POS) system will generate a payment request, displaying:\n    *   The USD amount due.\n    *   The equivalent BTC amount (and optionally in Satoshis).\n    *   A unique QR code for the payment address.\n    *   A time limit for payment (recommended 10-15 minutes due to price volatility).\n3.  **Payment Confirmation:** Upon customer payment, the employee must wait for the requisite number of network confirmations (minimum 2 confirmations as standard) as indicated by the wallet/PSP interface before considering the sale final and releasing goods or services.\n4.  **Receipt Issuance:** A digital or printed receipt must be issued stating:\n    *   Date and time.\n    *   USD amount charged.\n    *   BTC amount received at the time of transaction.\n    *   Transaction ID (TXID).\n    *   Exchange rate applied.\n\n### 5.2. Integration with Payment Systems\n1.  **Primary System:** All points of sale must be integrated with the **Chivo Wallet** business interface or an **Approved Payment Service Provider** that offers automatic conversion to USD.\n2.  **Automatic Conversion:** The company will configure its wallet/PSP to automatically convert received Bitcoin into USD and settle funds into the company's primary bank account daily. The company's functional accounting currency remains the US Dollar.\n3.  **Fallback Procedure:** In the event of a network or system failure with the primary wallet, a designated managerial employee may use a secure, company-approved backup wallet to generate a payment address manually. This transaction must be logged immediately on the **Manual Bitcoin Transaction Log**.\n\n### 5.3. Accounting Treatment\n1.  **Revenue Recognition:** All sales paid in Bitcoin will be recorded in the accounting system at the **USD equivalent value at the moment of transaction confirmation**.\n2.  **Daily Reconciliation:** The Finance Department will reconcile daily Bitcoin transaction reports from the wallet/PSP with POS system sales data and bank deposits of converted funds.\n3.  **Record Keeping:** The BTC amount, TXID, exchange rate, and final USD value for every transaction will be stored in the company's financial records for a minimum of 5 years, in accordance with tax and commercial regulations.\n4.  **Volatility Management:** The company does not hold Bitcoin as a treasury asset. The policy of immediate conversion to USD mitigates exposure to Bitcoin price volatility. Any minor discrepancies due to timing between transaction and conversion will be recorded as a foreign exchange gain/loss.\n\n### 5.4. Customer Communication Protocols\n1.  **Signage:** Clear signage stating \"Bitcoin Accepted Here\" with the Bitcoin logo will be displayed at all customer entrances and points of sale.\n2.  **Customer Education:** Front-line staff will be prepared to explain the process simply: \"We accept Bitcoin via QR code. The price in Bitcoin is calculated right now, and you will receive a receipt with the transaction details.\"\n3.  **Dispute Resolution:** For any transaction dispute, the TXID will be the primary proof of payment. Customer service will use blockchain explorers to verify transactions when necessary.\n\n### 5.5. Employee Training\n1.  **Mandatory Training:** All relevant employees will complete a mandatory training program covering:\n    *   Overview of the Bitcoin Law and this policy.\n    *   Step-by-step use of the integrated wallet/PSP at the POS.\n    *   How to read a blockchain transaction.\n    *   Customer communication guidelines.\n    *   Security protocols (e.g., never using personal wallets, verifying confirmations).\n2.  **Refresher Courses:** Training will be refreshed annually or when systems/procedures are updated.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n*   **Mandatory Acceptance:** Refusal to accept Bitcoin from a customer, without a bona fide and documented technological failure, is a violation of company policy and Salvadoran law, and may result in disciplinary action.\n*   **Audit:** The Finance and Compliance departments will conduct quarterly audits of Bitcoin transaction logs, reconciliation reports, and training records.\n*   **Reporting:** Any suspected fraud, security breach, or systemic failure related to Bitcoin transactions must be reported immediately to the Head of Finance and the Compliance Officer.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule\nThis policy shall be reviewed and updated:\n*   **Annually** by the Compliance and Finance departments.\n*   **Immediately** following any significant change to the Bitcoin Law or related regulations issued by the Central Reserve Bank of El Salvador or other competent authority.\n*   Following any major security incident or change in the company's payment infrastructure.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements\n*   **Primary Reference:** Legislative Decree No. 57, \"Ley Bitcoin,\" published in the Official Gazette No. 215, Volume 431, dated September 7, 2021. Article 7 establishes the obligation for every economic agent to accept Bitcoin as payment.\n*   **Supporting Regulations:** Subsequent regulations and circulars issued by the Central Reserve Bank of El Salvador (BCR) regarding the implementation of the Bitcoin Law.\n*   **Tax Compliance:** Guidelines from the Ministry of Finance regarding the tax treatment of transactions conducted with Bitcoin as legal tender.\n```"

Purpose and Scope\n### Purpose\nThis policy establishes a structured framework for assessing, approving, and monitoring engagement with cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin, with particular emphasis on stablecoins. Its purpose is to ensure that all such activities are conducted in a manner that proactively identifies and mitigates regulatory, financial, operational, and reputational risks, in alignment with the evolving regulatory landscape in El Salvador.\n\n### Scope\nThis policy applies to all employees, contractors, subsidiaries, and affiliated entities of [Organization Name] (hereinafter \"the Organization\") that engage in, or propose to engage in, any of the following activities:\n*   Trading, transacting, or holding cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin.\n*   Issuing, custodying, facilitating transactions with, or integrating services involving stablecoins.\n*   Partnering with or utilizing services from third-party stablecoin providers or cryptocurrency exchanges.\n*   Developing products or services that incorporate non-Bitcoin cryptocurrencies.\n\n## 3. Definitions\n*   **Bitcoin:** The decentralized digital currency defined and recognized as legal tender under El Salvador's Bitcoin Law.\n*   **Cryptocurrency (Crypto-Asset):** A digital or virtual asset designed to work as a medium of exchange, using cryptography to secure transactions and control the creation of additional units. For the purposes of this policy, this term explicitly **excludes** Bitcoin.\n*   **Stablecoin:** A type of cryptocurrency whose value is purportedly pegged to a stable asset or basket of assets, such as a fiat currency (e.g., USD, EUR) or commodities.\n*   **Regulatory Analysis:** The formal process of researching and evaluating the legal and regulatory status, requirements, and risks associated with a specific cryptocurrency or activity.\n*   **Due Diligence:** A comprehensive appraisal of a business, project, or third-party provider undertaken to establish its viability, stability, and compliance posture.\n*   **Authorized Entity:** An entity that has received formal authorization from the Central Reserve Bank of El Salvador (BCR) or another relevant regulatory body to issue or operate with stablecoins.\n*   **Policy Owner:** The Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) or designated equivalent.\n*   **Cryptocurrency Review Committee (CRC):** A cross-functional committee established per this policy to evaluate and approve proposals.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\nThe Organization recognizes the inherent risks associated with engaging in activities involving cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin, which operate in a developing and uncertain regulatory environment. The Organization is committed to the principle of proactive compliance. Therefore, **no activity involving non-Bitcoin cryptocurrencies, especially stablecoins, may be initiated without prior completion of a mandatory risk assessment and formal internal approval.** The Organization will only engage with stablecoin providers that demonstrate robust governance, transparency, and compliance with applicable laws, prioritizing those that are or are seeking to become Authorized Entities in El Salvador.\n\n## 5. Procedures\n\n### 5.1. Pre-Engagement Regulatory Analysis\n1.  Any business unit or individual seeking to engage in a proposed activity (\"Proponent\") must first complete a **Cryptocurrency Risk Assessment Form** (see Appendix A).\n2.

Review and Update Schedule\nThis policy shall be reviewed and updated at least annually by the Compliance Officer and senior management to ensure its continued effectiveness, relevance, and compliance with evolving regulations in El Salvador and international standards set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements\nThis policy is designed to ensure compliance with, but is not limited to, the following:\n*   The Anti-Money Laundering Law of El Salvador and its implementing regulations.\n*   The Bitcoin Law (Legislative Decree No. 57), with specific attention to its exemptions and the obligations that remain for licensed VASPs.\n*   Regulatory guidelines issued by the Central Reserve Bank of El Salvador and the Financial Investigation Unit (FIU).\n*   The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Recommendations, particularly Recommendation 15 and its Interpretive Note on Virtual Assets and VASPs.\n*   Applicable international sanctions programs.\n```"

Purpose and Scope\n**Purpose:** This policy establishes the mandatory framework for accepting Bitcoin as legal tender in compliance with El Salvador's Bitcoin Law (Ley Bitcoin). It ensures consistent, secure, and legally compliant handling of Bitcoin transactions across all business operations.\n\n**Scope:** This policy applies to all employees, contractors, agents, and representatives of [Company Name] who are involved in sales, customer service, accounting, or any function related to the solicitation, acceptance, processing, or recording of customer payments. It covers all goods and services offered by the company within the jurisdiction of El Salvador.\n\n## 3. Definitions\n*   **Bitcoin (BTC):** A decentralized digital currency operating on a peer-to-peer network, recognized as legal tender in El Salvador.\n*   **Legal Tender:** Currency that must be accepted if offered in payment of a debt. In El Salvador, this includes both the US Dollar (USD) and Bitcoin.\n*   **Bitcoin Law (Ley Bitcoin):** The Legislative Decree No. 57, enacted on September 7, 2021, granting Bitcoin the status of legal tender in El Salvador.\n*   **Chivo Wallet:** The official digital wallet provided by the Government of El Salvador for holding and transacting in Bitcoin and US Dollars.\n*   **Approved Payment Service Provider (PSP):** A third-party system or wallet, approved by [Company Name] and compliant with national regulations, for processing Bitcoin transactions (e.g., Strike, Muun, or other regulated custodial/non-custodial wallets).\n*   **Conversion:** The immediate exchange of received Bitcoin into US Dollars at the time of transaction, facilitated by the chosen wallet or PSP.\n*   **Satoshi (sats):** The smallest unit of Bitcoin (0.00000001 BTC).\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\nIn accordance with El Salvador's Bitcoin Law, [Company Name] recognizes Bitcoin as legal tender. Therefore, the company **must** accept Bitcoin as a form of payment for all goods and services from any customer who offers it, unless a specific, documented, and verifiable technological incapacity exists. The company will facilitate this acceptance through integrated systems, clear procedures, and trained personnel to ensure seamless, secure, and compliant transactions.\n\n## 5. Procedures\n\n### 5.1. Accepting Bitcoin Payments\n1.  **Price Quotation:** All displayed prices (in-store, online, on invoices) will be denoted in US Dollars (USD). At the point of sale, the equivalent Bitcoin amount will be calculated in real-time using the exchange rate provided by the integrated wallet or PSP.\n2.  **Transaction Initiation:** The employee or point-of-sale (POS) system will generate a payment request, displaying:\n    *   The USD amount due.\n    *   The equivalent BTC amount (and optionally in Satoshis).\n    *   A unique QR code for the payment address.\n    *   A time limit for payment (recommended 10-15 minutes due to price volatility).\n3.  **Payment Confirmation:** Upon customer payment, the employee must wait for the requisite number of network confirmations (minimum 2 confirmations as standard) as indicated by the wallet/PSP interface before considering the sale final and releasing goods or services.\n4.  **Receipt Issuance:** A digital or printed receipt must be issued stating:\n    *   Date and time.\n    *   USD amount charged.\n    *   BTC amount received at the time of transaction.\n    *   Transaction ID (TXID).\n    *   Exchange rate applied.\n\n### 5.2. Integration with Payment Systems\n1.  **Primary System:** All points of sale must be integrated with the **Chivo Wallet** business interface or an **Approved Payment Service Provider** that offers automatic conversion to USD.\n2.  **Automatic Conversion:** The company will configure its wallet/PSP to automatically convert received Bitcoin into USD and settle funds into the company's primary bank account daily. The company's functional accounting currency remains the US Dollar.\n3.  **Fallback Procedure:** In the event of a network or system failure with the primary wallet, a designated managerial employee may use a secure, company-approved backup wallet to generate a payment address manually. This transaction must be logged immediately on the **Manual Bitcoin Transaction Log**.\n\n### 5.3. Accounting Treatment\n1.  **Revenue Recognition:** All sales paid in Bitcoin will be recorded in the accounting system at the **USD equivalent value at the moment of transaction confirmation**.\n2.  **Daily Reconciliation:** The Finance Department will reconcile daily Bitcoin transaction reports from the wallet/PSP with POS system sales data and bank deposits of converted funds.\n3.  **Record Keeping:** The BTC amount, TXID, exchange rate, and final USD value for every transaction will be stored in the company's financial records for a minimum of 5 years, in accordance with tax and commercial regulations.\n4.  **Volatility Management:** The company does not hold Bitcoin as a treasury asset. The policy of immediate conversion to USD mitigates exposure to Bitcoin price volatility. Any minor discrepancies due to timing between transaction and conversion will be recorded as a foreign exchange gain/loss.\n\n### 5.4. Customer Communication Protocols\n1.  **Signage:** Clear signage stating \"Bitcoin Accepted Here\" with the Bitcoin logo will be displayed at all customer entrances and points of sale.\n2.  **Customer Education:** Front-line staff will be prepared to explain the process simply: \"We accept Bitcoin via QR code. The price in Bitcoin is calculated right now, and you will receive a receipt with the transaction details.\"\n3.  **Dispute Resolution:** For any transaction dispute, the TXID will be the primary proof of payment. Customer service will use blockchain explorers to verify transactions when necessary.\n\n### 5.5. Employee Training\n1.  **Mandatory Training:** All relevant employees will complete a mandatory training program covering:\n    *   Overview of the Bitcoin Law and this policy.\n    *   Step-by-step use of the integrated wallet/PSP at the POS.\n    *   How to read a blockchain transaction.\n    *   Customer communication guidelines.\n    *   Security protocols (e.g., never using personal wallets, verifying confirmations).\n2.  **Refresher Courses:** Training will be refreshed annually or when systems/procedures are updated.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n*   **Mandatory Acceptance:** Refusal to accept Bitcoin from a customer, without a bona fide and documented technological failure, is a violation of company policy and Salvadoran law, and may result in disciplinary action.\n*   **Audit:** The Finance and Compliance departments will conduct quarterly audits of Bitcoin transaction logs, reconciliation reports, and training records.\n*   **Reporting:** Any suspected fraud, security breach, or systemic failure related to Bitcoin transactions must be reported immediately to the Head of Finance and the Compliance Officer.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule\nThis policy shall be reviewed and updated:\n*   **Annually** by the Compliance and Finance departments.\n*   **Immediately** following any significant change to the Bitcoin Law or related regulations issued by the Central Reserve Bank of El Salvador or other competent authority.\n*   Following any major security incident or change in the company's payment infrastructure.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements\n*   **Primary Reference:** Legislative Decree No. 57, \"Ley Bitcoin,\" published in the Official Gazette No. 215, Volume 431, dated September 7, 2021. Article 7 establishes the obligation for every economic agent to accept Bitcoin as payment.\n*   **Supporting Regulations:** Subsequent regulations and circulars issued by the Central Reserve Bank of El Salvador (BCR) regarding the implementation of the Bitcoin Law.\n*   **Tax Compliance:** Guidelines from the Ministry of Finance regarding the tax treatment of transactions conducted with Bitcoin as legal tender.\n```"

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation El Salvador\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-01-30T22:11:20.038260\n\n## Executive Summary\nCRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY - The company currently has no policies addressing El Salvador's cryptocurrency regulatory requirements. This represents a severe compliance risk, particularly regarding the mandatory acceptance of Bitcoin as legal tender. Immediate action is required to develop and implement comprehensive cryptocurrency policies. The most critical gap is the absence of Bitcoin acceptance procedures required by national law. Additionally, significant gaps exist in AML, cybersecurity, and consumer protection areas that could result in regulatory sanctions, financial losses, and reputational damage. The company should prioritize developing a foundational cryptocurrency compliance framework before engaging in any cryptocurrency-related activities in El Salvador.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Legal Tender Status for Bitcoin - Under El Salvador's Bitcoin Law (Ley Bitcoin), Bitcoin is recognized as legal tender alongside the US dollar. Businesses must accept Bitcoin as payment unless they lack the technological capability to do so.\n\n**Current Status:** No policy exists regarding acceptance of Bitcoin as payment or handling of Bitcoin transactions.\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing Bitcoin acceptance, transaction processing, accounting, or customer communication regarding Bitcoin payments as required by Salvadoran law.\n\n**Impact:** Legal non-compliance with national law, potential fines, inability to operate legally in El Salvador, reputational damage, and possible criminal liability for company officers.\n\n**Recommendation:** Immediately develop and implement a Bitcoin Acceptance Policy that includes: 1) Procedures for accepting Bitcoin payments, 2) Integration with Chivo wallet or other approved systems, 3) Accounting treatment of Bitcoin transactions, 4) Customer communication protocols, 5) Employee training on Bitcoin transactions.\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin Regulation - While El Salvador has embraced Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies including stablecoins operate in a regulatory gray area. The Central Reserve Bank of El Salvador has indicated that entities issuing or operating with stablecoins may require authorization.\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop a Cryptocurrency Risk Assessment Policy that: 1) Requires regulatory analysis before engaging with any cryptocurrency beyond Bitcoin, 2) Establishes due diligence procedures for stablecoin providers, 3) Creates approval workflows for stablecoin-related activities, 4) Implements monitoring for regulatory developments.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) for Crypto Transactions - El Salvador requires Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) to comply with AML regulations. While the Bitcoin Law exempts some Bitcoin transactions, businesses must still monitor for suspicious activities.\n\n**Recommendation:** Create a Cryptocurrency AML/CFT Policy that includes: 1) Enhanced due diligence for large or suspicious crypto transactions, 2) Transaction monitoring specific to cryptocurrency patterns, 3) Reporting procedures for suspicious crypto activities, 4) Employee training on crypto-related financial crime risks.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-006\n**Requirement:** Cybersecurity for Digital Assets - While not explicitly detailed in the Bitcoin Law, businesses handling cryptocurrency have heightened cybersecurity obligations to protect customer funds and data.\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish a Cryptocurrency Security Policy that includes: 1) Secure private key management procedures, 2) Multi-signature requirements for large transactions, 3) Cold storage protocols for significant holdings, 4) Regular security audits of crypto systems, 5) Incident response plans for crypto breaches.\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **bitcoin_legal_tender_acceptance**: not_met\n❌ **stablecoin_regulatory_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **crypto_aml_requirements**: not_met\n❌ **cryptocurrency_tax_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **crypto_consumer_protection**: not_met\n❌ **digital_asset_cybersecurity**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update Summary\nGenerated: 2026-01-30T22:12:05.258113\n\n## Overview\nThis document summarizes proposed updates to company policies and standards based on regulatory gap analysis.\n\n## New Policies Required\n\n## Modified Policies\n\n### GAP-001\n**Category:** Legal\n**Current Policy:** No policy exists regarding acceptance of Bitcoin as payment or handling of Bitcoin transactions.\n**Proposed Change:** Immediately develop and implement a Bitcoin Acceptance Policy that includes: 1) Procedures for accepting Bitcoin payments, 2) Integration with Chivo wallet or other approved systems, 3) Accounting treatment of Bitcoin transactions, 4) Customer communication protocols, 5) Employee training on Bitcoin transactions.\n\n### GAP-002\n**Category:** Compliance\n**Current Policy:** No policies exist regarding stablecoin usage, trading, or custody.\n**Proposed Change:** Develop a Cryptocurrency Risk Assessment Policy that: 1) Requires regulatory analysis before engaging with any cryptocurrency beyond Bitcoin, 2) Establishes due diligence procedures for stablecoin providers, 3) Creates approval workflows for stablecoin-related activities, 4) Implements monitoring for regulatory developments.\n\n### GAP-003\n**Category:** AML/KYC\n**Current Policy:** No specific cryptocurrency AML policies exist. General AML policies may not address crypto-specific risks.\n**Proposed Change:** Create a Cryptocurrency AML/CFT Policy that includes: 1) Enhanced due diligence for large or suspicious crypto transactions, 2) Transaction monitoring specific to cryptocurrency patterns, 3) Reporting procedures for suspicious crypto activities, 4) Employee training on crypto-related financial crime risks.\n\n### GAP-004\n**Category:** Compliance\n**Current Policy:** No policies address tax treatment of cryptocurrency transactions.\n**Proposed Change:** Develop a Cryptocurrency Tax Compliance Policy that: 1) Establishes procedures for tracking cryptocurrency transactions for tax purposes, 2) Defines accounting methods for crypto assets, 3) Creates reporting workflows for tax obligations, 4) Includes consultation with Salvadoran tax experts.\n\n### GAP-005\n**Category:** Data Protection\n**Current Policy:** No consumer protection policies specific to cryptocurrency transactions.\n**Proposed Change:** Implement a Cryptocurrency Consumer Protection Policy covering: 1) Clear disclosure of exchange rates and fees, 2) Refund and return procedures for Bitcoin payments, 3) Customer education materials, 4) Complaint handling procedures for crypto-related issues.\n\n### GAP-006\n**Category:** Data Protection\n**Current Policy:** General cybersecurity policies may not address cryptocurrency-specific risks like private key management, wallet security, and smart contract risks.\n**Proposed Change:** Establish a Cryptocurrency Security Policy that includes: 1) Secure private key management procedures, 2) Multi-signature requirements for large transactions, 3) Cold storage protocols for significant holdings, 4) Regular security audits of crypto systems, 5) Incident response plans for crypto breaches.\n\n\n\n## Policy Implementation\n\n✅ **Automatically implemented 6 policies**\n\n📁 **Saved to:** C:\\Users\\takun\\Desktop\\Regulatory_Policies\n\n📄 **Summary file:** C:\\Users\\takun\\Desktop\\Regulatory_Policies\\IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md\n\n\n### Implemented Policies:\n\n- **GAP-001** (Legal) - Legal_GAP-001.md\n\n- **GAP-002** (Compliance) - Compliance_GAP-002.md\n\n- **GAP-003** (AML/KYC) - AML_KYC_GAP-003.md\n\n- **GAP-004** (Compliance) - Compliance_GAP-004.md\n\n- **GAP-005** (Data Protection) - Data Protection_GAP-005.md\n\n- **GAP-006** (Data Protection) - Data Protection_GAP-006.md\n\n\n"
