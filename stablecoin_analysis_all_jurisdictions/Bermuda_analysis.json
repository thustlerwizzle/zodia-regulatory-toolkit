There is a complete absence of documented policies addressing Bermuda's Digital Asset Business Act requirements. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive regulatory compliance program before any stablecoin operations can commence. The highest priority should be given to licensing strategy, AML/CFT compliance, and reserve management policies, as these represent the most severe regulatory risks. Without addressing these gaps, the company cannot legally operate a stablecoin business in Bermuda and faces significant regulatory, financial, and reputational risks."

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Bermuda\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-02-07T10:18:26.304925\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company exhibits critical compliance gaps across all major regulatory requirements for stablecoin operations in Bermuda. There is a complete absence of documented policies addressing Bermuda's Digital Asset Business Act requirements. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive regulatory compliance program before any stablecoin operations can commence. The highest priority should be given to licensing strategy, AML/CFT compliance, and reserve management policies, as these represent the most severe regulatory risks. Without addressing these gaps, the company cannot legally operate a stablecoin business in Bermuda and faces significant regulatory, financial, and reputational risks.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Bermuda's Digital Asset Business Act (DABA) requires licensing for stablecoin issuers, including capital requirements, governance standards, and consumer protection measures.\n\n**Current Status:** No documented stablecoin-specific policies found\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing Bermuda's stablecoin regulatory framework\n\n**Impact:** Legal non-compliance, potential regulatory enforcement actions, inability to operate legally in Bermuda, reputational damage\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive stablecoin policy framework aligned with DABA requirements, including licensing strategy, capital adequacy, redemption policies, and governance structures\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA) requires stablecoin issuers to maintain 1:1 reserves in high-quality liquid assets, with regular independent audits and public attestations.\n\n**Current Status:** No reserve management or audit policies documented\n\n**Gap:** Missing policies for reserve management, asset composition, audit requirements, and transparency reporting\n\n**Impact:** Failure to meet reserve requirements could lead to regulatory sanctions, loss of consumer confidence, and potential insolvency risks\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish reserve management policy specifying eligible assets, custody arrangements, audit frequency, and public reporting requirements\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance under Bermuda's Proceeds of Crime Act and related regulations, including KYC, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting.\n\n**Current Status:** No stablecoin-specific AML/CFT policies documented\n\n**Gap:** Existing AML policies (if any) not tailored to stablecoin transaction risks, wallet screening, or blockchain analytics requirements\n\n**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, potential criminal liability, and exclusion from financial systems\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop stablecoin-specific AML/CFT program including wallet screening, transaction monitoring for blockchain activities, and enhanced due diligence for large transactions\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** BMA requires comprehensive risk management frameworks including operational risk, liquidity risk, and cybersecurity protocols specific to stablecoin operations.\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop stablecoin risk management framework covering operational, liquidity, market, and technology risks with clear mitigation strategies\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection requirements including clear redemption rights, fee transparency, and complaint handling procedures.\n\n**Recommendation:** Create consumer protection policy detailing redemption rights, fee transparency, complaint procedures, and user education materials\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-006\n**Requirement:** Governance requirements including board oversight, compliance function independence, and regular regulatory reporting.\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish governance framework with clear roles, compliance function independence, board oversight committees, and regulatory reporting protocols\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **Bermuda DABA Licensing Requirements**: not_met\n❌ **Reserve Management & Audit Requirements**: not_met\n❌ **Risk Management Framework**: not_met\n❌ **Consumer Protection Measures**: not_met\n❌ **AML/CFT Compliance**: not_met\n❌ **Governance & Oversight**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update Summary\nGenerated:
