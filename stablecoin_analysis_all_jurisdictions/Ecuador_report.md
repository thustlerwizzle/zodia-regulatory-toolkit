# Gap Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
Overall compliance status is NON-COMPLIANT. The company lacks any documented policies addressing the core regulatory requirements for operating a stablecoin in Ecuador. The gaps are foundational and systemic, spanning legal authorization, financial integrity, consumer protection, and operational security. Immediate and comprehensive action is required before any market activity can be considered. The highest priority must be given to GAP-001 (Legal Authorization) and GAP-002 (AML/CFT), as these represent the most immediate legal and financial crime risks. The current state presents extreme legal, financial, and reputational risk.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Legal authorization to issue stablecoins. Ecuador's monetary system is dollarized, and the Central Bank of Ecuador (BCE) has historically maintained strict control over currency issuance. While there is no specific stablecoin law, any digital currency pegged to the USD would likely fall under financial and payment system regulations, requiring formal authorization from the BCE or Superintendency of Banks.

**Current Status:** No company policy identified. The current policies section is empty, indicating a complete lack of documented governance, risk, or compliance frameworks related to stablecoin operations in Ecuador.

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing the fundamental legal requirement for authorization to operate. The company has no documented process for obtaining, maintaining, or demonstrating regulatory approval from Ecuadorian authorities.

**Impact:** Operating without authorization could result in immediate cease-and-desist orders, significant fines, seizure of assets, criminal liability for directors, and permanent exclusion from the Ecuadorian market.

**Recommendation:** 1. Immediately suspend any operational activity in Ecuador until a legal assessment is complete. 2. Engage qualified Ecuadorian legal counsel to clarify the precise regulatory pathway (likely involving the BCE and/or Superintendency of Banks). 3. Develop a 'Regulatory Engagement and Licensing Policy' that outlines the steps to seek formal authorization.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CFT) compliance. Ecuador is a member of the Financial Action Task Force of Latin America (GAFILAT) and has AML/CFT laws (e.g., Organic Law for the Prevention of Money Laundering) that apply to financial entities and likely extend to issuers of value-stable digital assets. Requirements include KYC, customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and reporting suspicious activities to the Financial and Economic Analysis Unit (UAFE).

**Current Status:** No AML/CFT policy identified. The company lacks any framework for customer identification, risk assessment, ongoing monitoring, or reporting.

**Gap:** Total lack of policies and procedures to prevent the company's stablecoin from being used for money laundering or terrorist financing, which is a core regulatory expectation for any financial or payment service.

**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, including massive fines and license revocation. Increased risk of the company being used for illicit finance, damaging reputation irreparably. Potential for director liability.

**Recommendation:** Develop and implement a comprehensive 'AML/CFT Compliance Program' tailored to stablecoins. This must include: a Risk-Based Approach, Customer Identification Program (CIP/KYC), Customer Due Diligence (CDD) and Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) procedures, transaction monitoring systems, a designated Compliance Officer, and employee training. The program must ensure reporting to Ecuador's UAFE.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure. Financial regulators typically require clear, fair, and non-misleading communication with users. This includes transparent terms of service, disclosure of risks (e.g., redemption rights, underlying asset details, operational risks), and a mechanism for handling consumer complaints.

**Recommendation:** Create a 'Consumer Protection and Disclosure Policy'. This should mandate clear, Spanish-language disclosures about the stablecoin's mechanics, risks, fees, and redemption process. Establish a formal, documented complaints resolution procedure. Align all marketing materials with this policy.

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Reserve management and auditing. For a fiat-pegged stablecoin, regulators expect assurance that the issuer holds sufficient high-quality liquid assets (e.g., cash, cash equivalents, short-term government securities) to back all tokens in circulation at a 1:1 ratio. Regular, independent third-party audits are a standard expectation.

**Recommendation:** Develop a 'Reserve Management and Attestation Policy'. Specify the allowable assets for the reserve (prioritizing safety and liquidity), mandate a qualified, independent custodian, and require monthly attestation reports and quarterly full-reserve audits from a recognized accounting firm. Commit to public disclosure of these reports.

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Cybersecurity and operational resilience. Financial service providers are required to implement robust IT security controls, business continuity plans (BCP), and disaster recovery (DR) plans to protect user data and ensure continuous service availability.

**Recommendation:** Implement a comprehensive 'Information Security and Operational Resilience Policy'. This should be based on a framework like NIST or ISO 27001, include regular penetration testing, an incident response plan, and detailed BCP/DR plans that are tested annually.
