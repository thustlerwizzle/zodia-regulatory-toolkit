Policy Title\nAsset-Referenced Token (ART) Reserve Management, Custody, and Liquidity Policy\n\n## 2. Purpose and Scope\n\n### 2.1 Purpose\nThis policy establishes a comprehensive framework for the management, custody, valuation, and auditing of reserves backing Asset-Referenced Tokens (ARTs) issued by [Entity Name], in full compliance with Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 on Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCA). The primary objectives are to ensure:\n- The permanent and robust backing of all issued ARTs.\n- The protection of holders through strict segregation and safeguarding of reserve assets.\n- Transparent, accurate, and timely reporting.\n- Resilience under stressed market conditions.\n\n### 2.2 Scope\nThis policy applies to all business units, personnel, and third-party service providers involved in the issuance, management, custody, valuation, reporting, or auditing of ARTs and their backing reserves at [Entity Name]. It covers all ARTs issued that reference one or more official currencies.\n\n## 3. Definitions\n\n- **Asset-Referenced Token (ART):** A type of crypto-asset that purports to maintain a stable value by referencing the value of one or several official currencies.\n- **Reserve Assets:** The pool of secure, liquid, low-risk assets held to fully back the outstanding ARTs at all times.\n- **Reserve of Assets:** The total aggregate value of the Reserve Assets.\n- **Eligible Assets:** Assets that meet the criteria defined in Section 5.1 for inclusion in the reserve.\n- **Custodian:** A regulated credit institution or crypto-asset service provider (CASP) authorized for custody, responsible for safeguarding Reserve Assets.\n- **Independent Auditor:** A statutory auditor or audit firm, registered in accordance with EU Directive 2006/43/EC, conducting the mandatory reserve attestation.\n- **Liquidity Requirement:** The obligation to ensure that a sufficient proportion of Reserve Assets can be converted to the referenced currency within one business day to meet potential redemption requests.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\n\n[Entity Name] is committed to maintaining a Reserve of Assets that, at all times, equals or exceeds the aggregate value of all claims from holders of its issued ARTs. The reserve will be managed with utmost prudence, emphasizing safety, liquidity, and transparency. All Reserve Assets will be segregated from the entity's own assets, held with regulated third-party custodians, and subject to daily valuation, rigorous internal controls, independent audit, and regular stress testing.\n\n## 5. Procedures\n\n### 5.1 Reserve Composition & Eligible Assets\n1.  **Primary Composition:** A minimum of 80% of the Reserve of Assets must be held in **Highly Liquid, Low-Risk Instruments**, including:\n    - Deposits held in credit institutions.\n    - Sovereign debt securities (e.g., EU Member State bonds, US Treasuries) with a credit assessment of at least Credit Quality Step 2.\n    - Short-term money market fund units.\n2.  **Supplementary Composition:** Up to 20% of the reserve may include:\n    - High-quality corporate bonds (minimum credit rating as per internal credit policy).\n    - Physically settled reverse repurchase agreements with a maturity of no more than seven days.\n3.  **Prohibited Assets:** Crypto-assets, own issued ARTs, and illiquid or high-risk assets are strictly prohibited from the reserve.\n\n### 5.2 Custody and Segregation\n1.  All Reserve Assets must be held with one or more **Independent Custodians** that are:\n    - Regulated credit institutions (preferred) or CASPs authorized for custody under MiCA.\n    - Subject to robust due diligence prior to engagement.\n2.  **Legal Segregation:** Reserve Assets must be legally segregated from the assets of [Entity Name] and from the assets of the Custodian.

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Greece\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-01-30T23:35:27.431536\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company exhibits a complete absence of documented policies addressing stablecoin regulatory requirements in Greece/EU. Based on the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation that will govern stablecoins in the EU, including Greece, all critical regulatory areas are currently non-compliant. The company faces significant regulatory risk and cannot legally operate stablecoin services in Greece without addressing these fundamental gaps. Immediate action is required to develop comprehensive policies and procedures before considering market entry. The most critical gaps relate to licensing authorization, reserve management, and AML/CTF compliance, which would likely prevent regulatory approval if not addressed.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Registration/Licensing for stablecoin issuance or provision of related services in Greece (based on EU-wide MiCA framework expected to apply)\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing the need for regulatory authorization to issue stablecoins or provide related services in the Greek/EU market. No process exists for obtaining necessary licenses from the Hellenic Capital Market Commission or other relevant authorities.\n\n**Impact:** Operating without required authorization could result in enforcement actions, fines, business suspension, reputational damage, and inability to legally offer services in Greece/EU.\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Immediately establish a regulatory licensing strategy team. 2. Develop a comprehensive licensing application process document. 3. Create a regulatory engagement protocol for communications with Greek/EU authorities. 4. Implement a regulatory monitoring system for MiCA implementation timelines.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Reserve management and backing requirements for asset-referenced tokens (stablecoins) under MiCA\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found\n\n**Gap:** No policies exist regarding reserve composition, custody, segregation, valuation, or audit requirements for stablecoin backing assets. No procedures for maintaining adequate liquidity or ensuring 1:1 backing.\n\n**Impact:** Failure to maintain proper reserves could lead to stablecoin depegging, loss of consumer confidence, regulatory sanctions, and potential insolvency issues.\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Develop a comprehensive reserve management policy specifying eligible assets, custody arrangements, and segregation requirements. 2. Implement daily reserve valuation and reporting procedures. 3. Establish independent audit protocols. 4. Create liquidity management and stress testing frameworks.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance for stablecoin transactions\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found\n\n**Gap:** No specific AML/CTF policies addressing stablecoin transactions, despite Greece's implementation of EU AML directives. No procedures for customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, or suspicious activity reporting specific to stablecoin operations.\n\n**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, potential criminal liability, loss of banking relationships, and inclusion in regulatory blacklists.\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Develop stablecoin-specific AML/CTF policy incorporating Travel Rule requirements. 2. Implement blockchain analytics tools for transaction monitoring. 3. Create customer risk assessment framework for stablecoin users. 4. Establish reporting protocols to Greek Financial Intelligence Unit.\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements including whitepaper approval and ongoing transparency\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Create a disclosure policy compliant with MiCA Article 19 requirements. 2. Develop whitepaper creation and approval workflow. 3. Implement ongoing disclosure procedures for material changes. 4. Establish complaint handling and redress mechanisms.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Governance and risk management framework requirements under MiCA\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Establish a comprehensive governance framework document. 2. Develop risk management policy covering market, liquidity, operational, and custody risks. 3. Implement internal control procedures. 4. Create business continuity and incident response plans.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-006\n**Requirement:** Capital requirements and own funds obligations for stablecoin issuers\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Develop capital management policy aligned with MiCA Article 34. 2. Establish capital monitoring and reporting procedures. 3. Create capital planning and stress testing framework. 4. Document capital allocation and maintenance protocols.\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **licensing_authorization**: not_met\n❌ **reserve_management**: not_met\n❌ **consumer_protection**: not_met\n❌ **aml_ctf_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **governance_framework**: not_met\n❌ **capital_requirements**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update Summary\nGenerated: 2026-01-30T23:36:10.057882\n\n## Overview\nThis document summarizes proposed updates to company policies and standards based on regulatory gap analysis.\n\n## New Policies Required\n\n## Modified Policies\n\n### GAP-001\n**Category:** Compliance\n**Current Policy:** No documented policy found\n**Proposed Change:** 1.
