# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-06T00:58:42.437272

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits a complete absence of documented policies addressing Malta's stablecoin regulatory framework. All critical regulatory requirements under the MFSA VFA Rulebook and related legislation remain unaddressed. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive compliance framework before any stablecoin operations can commence in Malta. The current state represents high regulatory risk and would prevent successful licensing application or lawful operation. Priority should be given to establishing core governance, AML/CTF, and reserve management policies as foundational elements.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** MFSA VFA Rulebook requirements for stablecoin issuers including governance, risk management, capital requirements, and consumer protection

**Current Status:** No documented stablecoin-specific policies found

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing Malta's Virtual Financial Assets (VFA) regulatory framework for stablecoin issuance and management

**Impact:** Legal non-compliance, potential regulatory enforcement actions, inability to operate legally in Malta, reputational damage

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive stablecoin policy framework aligned with MFSA VFA Rulebook, including governance structure, risk management protocols, and capital adequacy requirements

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** MFSA requirement for stablecoin reserve management and transparency (Rule 10 of VFA Rulebook)

**Current Status:** No reserve management or transparency policies documented

**Gap:** Missing policies for reserve asset composition, custody arrangements, regular attestations, and public disclosure of reserve holdings

**Impact:** Failure to maintain adequate reserves could lead to insolvency, regulatory sanctions, and loss of consumer trust

**Recommendation:** Establish reserve management policy detailing asset types, custody solutions, audit requirements, and public disclosure mechanisms

### Gap 3: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) requirements under Malta's Prevention of Money Laundering Act

**Current Status:** No AML/CTF policies specific to stablecoin operations documented

**Gap:** Missing customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting procedures for stablecoin transactions

**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties, potential criminal liability, and inclusion in international watchlists

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive AML/CTF program specifically designed for stablecoin operations, including KYC procedures and transaction monitoring

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** MFSA licensing requirements for VFA service providers (Part B of VFA Act)

**Recommendation:** Develop licensing compliance framework and conduct readiness assessment for MFSA VFA Service Provider license application

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Consumer protection requirements including clear disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling (MFSA Conduct of Business Rules)

**Recommendation:** Develop consumer protection framework including clear disclosures, redemption policies, and complaint handling procedures

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity requirements (MFSA Technology Arrangements Guidelines)

**Recommendation:** Establish comprehensive cybersecurity and operational resilience framework including penetration testing, incident response plans, and smart contract audits
