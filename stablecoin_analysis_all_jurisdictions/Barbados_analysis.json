Purpose and Scope\n### 2.1 Purpose\nThis policy establishes the framework for maintaining full backing reserves for all issued stablecoins in accordance with the Barbados regulatory framework for digital assets. The policy ensures that reserves are held in high-quality liquid assets, are securely custodied, and are subject to independent verification and transparent disclosure.\n\n### 2.2 Scope\nThis policy applies to:\n- All stablecoin issuance activities conducted by the Company.\n- All personnel involved in treasury management, reserve custody, compliance, and financial reporting.\n- All third-party service providers, including custodians and auditors, engaged in reserve management activities.\n\n## 3. Definitions\n- **Stablecoin:** A digital asset issued by the Company designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified fiat currency (e.g., 1:1 with the Barbados Dollar or US Dollar).\n- **Reserve Assets:** The collective pool of assets held to fully back the outstanding supply of stablecoins.\n- **High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA):** Assets that are low risk, easy to value, and can be liquidated promptly with minimal loss of value under stressed market conditions, as defined in Section 5.1.\n- **Qualified Custodian:** A regulated financial institution or trust company that provides custodial services for digital and/or traditional assets, meeting the standards outlined in Section 5.3.\n- **Independent Attestation:** A monthly examination and report issued by an independent third-party audit firm verifying the composition, value, and sufficiency of the reserve assets.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\nIt is the policy of the Company to maintain at all times a 1:1 reserve of HQLA for the total face value of all stablecoins in circulation. Reserves will be held separately from the Company's operational funds, managed with a primary objective of capital preservation and liquidity, and subject to rigorous independent oversight and public transparency.\n\n## 5. Procedures\n\n### 5.1 Eligible Reserve Asset Classes\nReserve assets must be comprised exclusively of the following HQLA tiers:\n- **Tier 1A:** Cash and cash equivalents held in segregated accounts at regulated financial institutions in jurisdictions with strong regulatory oversight.\n- **Tier 1B:** Short-term (maturity < 90 days) sovereign debt securities issued by national governments with a credit rating of 'AA-' or higher from a recognized credit rating agency.\n- **Tier 2:** Highly-rated, liquid money market funds that invest exclusively in Tier 1A and 1B assets. Exposure to any single Tier 2 instrument is limited to 10% of total reserves.\n\n### 5.2 Minimum Liquidity Requirements\n- A minimum of **85%** of total reserves must be held in Tier 1A and Tier 1B assets combined.\n- No more than **15%** of total reserves may be held in Tier 2 assets.\n- The weighted average maturity of the entire reserve portfolio shall not exceed 60 days.\n\n### 5.3 Custody Arrangements\n- All reserve assets must be held with one or more Qualified Custodians.\n- Custodial agreements must ensure clear segregation of assets, prohibiting commingling with the custodian's or the Company's operational assets.\n- The Company must maintain direct, real-time read-only access to custodial accounts for monitoring purposes.\n- A quarterly review of all custodians must be performed to ensure ongoing compliance with qualification standards.\n\n### 5.4 Reserve Valuation and Sufficiency\n- The total market value of the reserve portfolio will be valued daily using mark-to-market principles.\n- The Company's Treasury Department must ensure the total value of reserves meets or exceeds the total face value of outstanding stablecoins at the close of each business day.\n- Pre-defined procedures for adding to reserves upon new stablecoin issuance and releasing assets upon stablecoin redemption must be documented and followed.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n\n### 6.1 Independent Monthly Attestation\n- The Company must engage an independent, internationally recognized audit firm.\n- The auditor will perform agreed-upon procedures monthly and issue an attestation report confirming:\n    1. The composition and classification of reserve assets.\n    2. The market value of the reserve portfolio.\n    3. The sufficiency of reserves relative to outstanding stablecoins.\n- The final report must be received by the 15th business day following the month-end.\n\n### 6.2 Public Disclosure Framework\n- A dedicated, publicly accessible page on the Company's website will display reserve information.\n- The following must be updated at least monthly, within 5 business days of receiving the independent attestation:\n    1. The total face value of stablecoins in circulation.\n    2. The total value and breakdown of reserve assets by category (Tier 1A, 1B, Tier 2).\n    3. The name(s) of the Qualified Custodian(s).\n    4. A link to the most recent independent attestation report.\n- The Company will promptly disclose any material deviation from this policy or any event impacting reserve sufficiency.\n\n### 6.3 Internal Controls & Reporting\n- The Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) are jointly responsible for policy implementation.\n- Daily reserve reports must be generated for internal review by the Treasury and Compliance teams.\n- Any breach of the reserve requirements must be escalated immediately to the CCO, CFO, and the Board's Risk Committee.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule\nThis policy shall be reviewed annually by the Compliance Department in conjunction with the Legal and Treasury Departments. Updates will be made to reflect changes in:\n- The Barbados regulatory framework for digital assets.\n- Market standards for HQLA and custody.\n- The Company's product offerings or risk profile.\nAll revisions require approval by the Company's Board of Directors or its designated committee.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements\nThis policy is designed to ensure compliance with, but is not limited to, the following regulatory expectations as derived from the Barbados regulatory framework for digital assets:\n- The requirement for full backing of stablecoins.\n- The mandate to hold backing reserves in high-quality, liquid assets.\n- The principles of segregation of client/assets and secure custody.\n- The expectations for transparency, audit, and disclosure to stablecoin holders and the public.\n```\n*Policy Version: 1.0  \nEffective Date: [Date]  \nApproved By: [Board of Directors/Governance Committee]*"

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Barbados\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-01-30T18:39:22.681260\n\n## Executive Summary\nCRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently operates with no documented policies addressing Barbados stablecoin regulatory requirements. All core regulatory areas show complete non-compliance, creating severe legal, operational, and reputational risks. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive compliance framework before commencing operations. Priority should be given to licensing, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance, as these represent the most immediate regulatory enforcement risks. The company should engage local Barbados legal counsel and compliance experts to ensure proper interpretation and implementation of regulatory requirements.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must maintain full backing reserves in high-quality liquid assets (Barbados regulatory framework for digital assets)\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy on reserve management or asset backing\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policies governing reserve composition, custody, verification, or reporting\n\n**Impact:** Regulatory enforcement action, license revocation, loss of customer trust, potential insolvency risk\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop and implement a comprehensive Reserve Management Policy specifying: 1) Eligible asset classes, 2) Minimum liquidity requirements, 3) Custody arrangements with qualified custodians, 4) Monthly independent attestation/audit requirements, 5) Public disclosure framework\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Mandatory licensing/registration with Barbados Financial Services Commission (FSC) for digital asset businesses\n\n**Current Status:** No documented licensing strategy or compliance framework\n\n**Gap:** No policies addressing regulatory registration, ongoing reporting, or supervisory engagement\n\n**Impact:** Operating illegally, severe penalties including fines and criminal liability, inability to access banking services\n\n**Recommendation:** Immediately develop Regulatory Engagement Policy including: 1) License application roadmap, 2) Designated compliance officer role, 3) Regulatory reporting calendar, 4) FSC communication protocols, 5) Change-in-control notification procedures\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting (Barbados AML Act and FSC guidelines)\n\n**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT program\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls\n\n**Impact:** Regulatory sanctions, financial penalties, reputational damage, potential criminal liability for directors\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish comprehensive AML/CFT Program including: 1) Risk-based customer identification and verification, 2) Ongoing transaction monitoring system, 3) Suspicious activity reporting procedures, 4) Designated AML compliance officer, 5) Regular employee training\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection requirements including clear disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling (Barbados consumer financial protection regulations)\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop Consumer Protection Framework covering: 1) Clear terms of service and risk disclosures, 2) Transparent fee structure, 3) Redemption procedures and timelines, 4) Formal complaint handling process, 5) Dispute resolution mechanism\n\n### Gap 2:
