# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-31T07:01:00.953717

## Executive Summary
The company currently exhibits comprehensive non-compliance with stablecoin regulatory requirements in Kiribati. No policies exist to address fundamental regulatory obligations including licensing, reserve management, AML/CTF, consumer protection, or operational risk. This represents an extremely high-risk operational state that requires immediate remediation. The company should not conduct any stablecoin operations until critical gaps (GAP-001 through GAP-003) are addressed. A phased remediation approach is recommended, starting with regulatory engagement and authorization, followed by implementation of core compliance frameworks. Given the absence of specific Kiribati regulations in available research, the analysis is based on international standards and likely regulatory expectations for digital asset services.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance and operation require formal authorization from Kiribati's financial regulator (likely Ministry of Finance & Economic Development or similar authority).

**Current Status:** No documented policy exists regarding regulatory authorization requirements for stablecoin operations.

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing licensing, registration, or authorization requirements for operating stablecoin services in Kiribati.

**Impact:** Operating without proper authorization could result in regulatory enforcement actions, fines, business suspension, reputational damage, and potential criminal liability.

**Recommendation:** 1. Conduct formal regulatory outreach to determine exact authorization requirements. 2. Develop a licensing application policy and procedure. 3. Create a regulatory engagement framework for ongoing compliance.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must maintain adequate reserves to back all issued tokens (likely 1:1 or similar requirement).

**Current Status:** No reserve management or backing policies exist.

**Gap:** No policies governing reserve composition, custody, auditing, or transparency requirements for stablecoin backing assets.

**Impact:** Failure to maintain adequate reserves could lead to loss of peg, consumer harm, regulatory sanctions, and loss of market confidence.

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop a comprehensive reserve management policy specifying asset types, custody arrangements, and audit requirements. 2. Implement regular attestation or audit procedures. 3. Create public disclosure framework for reserve composition.

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance for digital asset services.

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CTF policies specific to stablecoin operations.

**Gap:** Lack of customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and record-keeping policies tailored to stablecoin transactions.

**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties, potential criminal liability, loss of banking relationships, and inclusion on international watchlists.

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop a risk-based AML/CTF program specific to stablecoin services. 2. Implement KYC/CDD procedures for all users. 3. Establish transaction monitoring and reporting systems.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling.

**Recommendation:** 1. Create comprehensive terms of service and user agreements. 2. Establish clear redemption procedures. 3. Develop a consumer complaint handling framework. 4. Implement transparent fee disclosure policies.

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity requirements for digital asset services.

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop a comprehensive operational risk framework. 2. Implement cybersecurity controls specific to digital asset infrastructure. 3. Create incident response and business continuity plans.
