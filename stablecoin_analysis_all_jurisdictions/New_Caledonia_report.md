# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-12T12:59:51.885970

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits a complete absence of policies addressing stablecoin regulatory requirements. Based on standard financial regulatory frameworks and emerging digital asset regulations, all critical regulatory areas are unaddressed. The company is operating in a state of significant regulatory non-compliance with exposure to enforcement actions, financial penalties, operational shutdowns, and criminal liability. Immediate development of a comprehensive regulatory compliance program is required before any stablecoin operations should commence. Given New Caledonia's status as a French territory, EU regulatory frameworks (particularly MiCA - Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation) should be considered as a baseline, along with French financial regulations and any local Pacific Island financial service requirements.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance and operation requires authorization from financial regulatory authorities (based on standard financial regulatory frameworks in developed jurisdictions)

**Current Status:** No documented policy for stablecoin issuance authorization

**Gap:** Complete absence of policy addressing regulatory authorization requirements for issuing or operating stablecoins in New Caledonia or any jurisdiction

**Impact:** Potential for regulatory enforcement actions, fines, license revocation, and criminal liability for unauthorized financial activities

**Recommendation:** Develop and implement a regulatory authorization policy that includes: 1) Jurisdictional analysis for stablecoin operations, 2) Application process for regulatory approvals, 3) Ongoing compliance monitoring for authorization maintenance

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must maintain adequate reserves to back issued tokens (standard requirement in most jurisdictions with stablecoin regulations)

**Current Status:** No reserve management policy exists

**Gap:** No policy governing reserve composition, custody, auditing, or transparency requirements for backing stablecoins

**Impact:** Risk of insolvency, loss of peg, consumer harm, and regulatory sanctions for misleading representations about token backing

**Recommendation:** Create comprehensive reserve management policy including: 1) Reserve composition requirements, 2) Custody arrangements, 3) Independent audit requirements, 4) Public disclosure protocols, 5) Redemption procedures

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance for virtual asset service providers (VASPs)

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CTF policy for stablecoin operations

**Gap:** Complete absence of AML/CTF framework specific to stablecoin transactions, customer due diligence, or suspicious activity monitoring

**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties, potential criminal liability, loss of banking relationships, and reputational damage

**Recommendation:** Develop VASP-specific AML/CTF program including: 1) Customer identification and verification procedures, 2) Transaction monitoring systems, 3) Suspicious activity reporting protocols, 4) Record-keeping requirements, 5) Staff training programs

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including disclosures, risk warnings, and complaint handling

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive consumer protection framework including: 1) Clear risk disclosure documents, 2) Complaint handling procedures, 3) Redress mechanisms, 4) Marketing and advertising guidelines, 5) Customer education materials

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity requirements for digital asset operations

**Recommendation:** Establish digital asset operational risk policy covering: 1) Smart contract security protocols, 2) Private key management and storage, 3) System redundancy and disaster recovery, 4) Cybersecurity controls, 5) Incident response procedures
