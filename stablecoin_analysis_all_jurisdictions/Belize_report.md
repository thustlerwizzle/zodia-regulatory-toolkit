# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T18:56:30.943927

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits complete non-compliance with Belize's stablecoin regulatory framework. No policies exist to address any of the core regulatory requirements for stablecoin operations. This represents an extremely high-risk situation requiring immediate and comprehensive remediation. All identified gaps are either critical or high priority, with the most urgent being licensing, reserve management, and AML/CTF compliance. The company must immediately cease any stablecoin-related operations until basic compliance frameworks are established and approved by regulatory authorities.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must obtain a license from the International Financial Services Commission (IFSC) of Belize under the International Financial Services Commission Act and related regulations.

**Current Status:** No documented policy regarding licensing requirements for stablecoin operations.

**Gap:** Complete absence of policy addressing licensing requirements for issuing or operating stablecoins in Belize.

**Impact:** Operating without proper licensing could result in regulatory enforcement actions, fines, business shutdown, and reputational damage.

**Recommendation:** Develop and implement a licensing compliance policy that outlines requirements for obtaining and maintaining IFSC authorization for stablecoin operations.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must maintain adequate reserves to back issued tokens at a 1:1 ratio, with regular independent audits of reserve holdings.

**Current Status:** No documented reserve management or audit policies for stablecoin operations.

**Gap:** Missing policies governing reserve requirements, custody arrangements, and audit procedures for stablecoin backing assets.

**Impact:** Failure to maintain adequate reserves could lead to regulatory sanctions, loss of consumer confidence, and potential insolvency.

**Recommendation:** Create comprehensive reserve management and audit policies specifying reserve composition, custody arrangements, reporting requirements, and independent audit procedures.

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Implementation of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) programs compliant with Belize's Money Laundering and Terrorism (Prevention) Act.

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CTF policies specific to stablecoin operations.

**Gap:** Lack of tailored AML/CTF policies addressing stablecoin-specific risks, including transaction monitoring, customer due diligence, and suspicious activity reporting.

**Impact:** Significant regulatory and legal exposure, potential criminal liability, and inclusion in international sanctions lists.

**Recommendation:** Develop stablecoin-specific AML/CTF policies including KYC procedures, transaction monitoring, risk assessment, and reporting protocols.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including clear disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling procedures.

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive consumer protection policies covering disclosures, redemption procedures, complaint handling, and dispute resolution mechanisms.

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Cybersecurity and operational resilience requirements for digital asset operations.

**Recommendation:** Develop cybersecurity and operational resilience policies including access controls, incident response plans, penetration testing, and business continuity procedures.

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Regular reporting to regulatory authorities including financial statements, transaction reports, and compliance certifications.

**Recommendation:** Establish regulatory reporting policies detailing reporting requirements, schedules, responsible personnel, and review procedures.
