This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Guinea-Bissau\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-01-30T23:56:30.139909\n\n## Executive Summary\nCRITICAL COMPLIANCE FAILURE: The company has no documented policies for stablecoin operations in Guinea-Bissau, representing a complete regulatory vacuum. All fundamental regulatory requirements for financial services and digital assets are unmet. The company is exposed to severe legal, financial, and reputational risks. Immediate cessation of stablecoin operations is recommended until basic compliance frameworks are established. Priority must be given to: 1) Legal assessment of Guinea-Bissau's regulatory landscape, 2) Implementation of AML/CTF controls, 3) Licensing compliance, and 4) Consumer protection measures. The absence of any policies suggests the company may be operating without proper regulatory analysis or oversight.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Legal framework for stablecoin issuance and operation\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policies exist\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of any policy framework addressing stablecoin operations, issuance, custody, or redemption\n\n**Impact:** Company is operating in regulatory vacuum with high risk of enforcement actions, license revocation, or criminal liability if Guinea-Bissau establishes regulations\n\n**Recommendation:** Immediately suspend stablecoin operations until comprehensive legal analysis of Guinea-Bissau's financial regulations is completed. Establish interim policy prohibiting stablecoin activities pending regulatory clarity.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance\n\n**Current Status:** No AML/CTF policies documented\n\n**Gap:** No customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, or record-keeping procedures for stablecoin transactions\n\n**Impact:** High risk of facilitating illicit financial activities, potential criminal liability, and severe regulatory sanctions\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive AML/CTF program including: 1) Customer identification and verification procedures, 2) Transaction monitoring system, 3) Suspicious activity reporting protocols, 4) Record retention policies meeting minimum 5-year requirement\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Licensing and registration requirements\n\n**Current Status:** No licensing compliance procedures\n\n**Gap:** No process for identifying, applying for, or maintaining required financial services licenses\n\n**Impact:** Operating without required licenses could result in immediate shutdown, fines, and criminal prosecution\n\n**Recommendation:** Conduct immediate legal assessment to determine if stablecoin operations require: 1) Payment institution license, 2) E-money license, 3) Banking license, or 4) Specialized digital asset license.
