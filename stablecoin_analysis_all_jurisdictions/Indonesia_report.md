# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-31T00:35:19.090221

## Executive Summary
The company currently has no documented policies addressing Indonesian stablecoin regulations. This represents a critical compliance failure with immediate operational and legal risks. All six identified regulatory areas show complete non-compliance (not_met status). The company cannot legally operate stablecoin services in Indonesia without addressing these fundamental gaps. Immediate action is required, starting with licensing strategy and reserve management policies, followed by comprehensive AML/CFT and reporting frameworks. Engagement with local legal counsel and regulatory consultants is strongly recommended before any market entry or operational activities.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Bank Indonesia (BI) Regulation No. 22/23/PBI/2020 requires stablecoin issuers to obtain a license as a Payment System Service Provider (PJSP) or collaborate with a licensed PJSP

**Current Status:** No documented policy on licensing requirements for stablecoin operations

**Gap:** Complete absence of policy addressing mandatory licensing framework for stablecoin issuance or service provision in Indonesia

**Impact:** Legal prohibition of operations, potential criminal penalties, business shutdown, and significant fines

**Recommendation:** Immediately develop a licensing strategy policy that addresses: 1) Assessment of whether to obtain PJSP license or partner with existing PJSP, 2) Application process and timeline, 3) Required capital and governance structures

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** BI Regulation mandates that stablecoins must be backed 1:1 by Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) held in segregated accounts at Indonesian banks

**Current Status:** No policy on reserve management, custody, or asset backing requirements

**Gap:** No framework for maintaining adequate reserves, segregation of customer funds, or banking relationships in Indonesia

**Impact:** Regulatory enforcement action, loss of customer trust, potential fraud allegations, and inability to operate legally

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive reserve management policy including: 1) 100% IDR backing requirement, 2) Segregated account structure with Indonesian banks, 3) Monthly attestation and audit requirements, 4) Liquidity management procedures

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Financial Services Authority (OJK) regulations require AML/CFT compliance including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and reporting suspicious transactions

**Recommendation:** Create Indonesia-specific AML/CFT policy aligned with OJK regulations, including: 1) Customer identification and verification procedures, 2) Transaction monitoring thresholds, 3) Reporting mechanisms to PPATK (Indonesian FIU), 4) Risk-based approach documentation

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** BI regulations require regular reporting including monthly reserve reports, quarterly operational reports, and annual audited financial statements

**Recommendation:** Establish regulatory reporting policy covering: 1) Report types and frequencies, 2) Responsible personnel and approval workflows, 3) Quality control procedures, 4) Record retention requirements
