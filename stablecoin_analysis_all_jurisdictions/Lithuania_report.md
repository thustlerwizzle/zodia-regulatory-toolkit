# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-06T00:16:58.648568

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits a critical compliance gap with zero established policies addressing Lithuanian stablecoin regulatory requirements. All essential regulatory domains show 'not met' status, indicating complete non-compliance with financial market regulations. Immediate action is required to develop comprehensive policies across all regulatory areas, with priority given to licensing, AML/CTF, and reserve management requirements. The current state poses severe legal, operational, and reputational risks that could result in regulatory enforcement actions, including potential prohibition of operations in Lithuania.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Authorization/Licensing for stablecoin issuance and related services under Lithuanian financial market regulations (Bank of Lithuania oversight)

**Current Status:** No documented policy found regarding licensing requirements for stablecoin operations

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing the need for proper authorization from the Bank of Lithuania to issue, manage, or facilitate stablecoin transactions

**Impact:** Potential for regulatory enforcement actions, fines, license revocation, and criminal liability for operating without proper authorization

**Recommendation:** Immediately establish a licensing framework policy that identifies required authorizations, application procedures, and ongoing compliance obligations with the Bank of Lithuania

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance for virtual asset service providers (VASP registration with FCIS)

**Current Status:** No AML/CTF policy specific to stablecoin operations identified

**Gap:** Missing comprehensive AML/CTF program addressing customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and VASP registration requirements

**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties, reputational damage, potential criminal liability, and inability to operate legally in Lithuania

**Recommendation:** Develop and implement a comprehensive AML/CTF policy aligned with Lithuanian Law on Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing, including FCIS registration procedures

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Reserve requirements and asset backing for stablecoin issuers (must maintain 1:1 backing with high-quality liquid assets)

**Current Status:** No reserve management or asset backing policies documented

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies governing reserve composition, custody, auditing, and transparency requirements for stablecoin backing assets

**Impact:** Risk of stablecoin depegging, loss of consumer confidence, regulatory intervention, and potential insolvency proceedings

**Recommendation:** Create detailed reserve management policy specifying eligible assets, custody arrangements, regular auditing requirements, and public disclosure protocols

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including clear disclosures, redemption rights, and risk warnings

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive consumer protection policy covering all aspects of stablecoin issuance, management, and redemption processes

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity requirements for digital asset operations

**Recommendation:** Develop operational risk management framework including cybersecurity protocols, smart contract security standards, and business continuity planning

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Reporting and transparency obligations to regulatory authorities

**Recommendation:** Establish regulatory reporting policy detailing reporting requirements, timelines, responsible personnel, and documentation procedures
