Any employee who suspects money laundering or terrorist financing must immediately submit an **Internal SAR** to the MLRO.\n2.  The MLRO will independently assess the report. If suspicion remains, the MLRO will promptly submit an **External SAR** to the JFIU via the prescribed channel.\n3.  **Tipping-off** (disclosing that a SAR has been made) is a criminal offence and is strictly prohibited.\n\n### 5.6 Record Keeping\n*   All CDD records, business correspondence, and transaction records must be kept for a minimum of **10 years** from the date the business relationship ends or the transaction is completed.\n*   Records must be readily retrievable and available to the JFSC, JFIU, or law enforcement upon request.\n\n### 5.7 Training & Awareness\n*   All employees will receive **induction AML/CFT training** upon joining.\n*   **Annual refresher training** will be provided to all staff, with content tailored to their role and the Firm’s risk profile.\n*   Training records will be maintained by the MLCO.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n\n*   All personnel are required to read, understand, and adhere to this policy.\n*   The MLCO is responsible for monitoring compliance and testing the effectiveness of procedures.\n*   Breaches of this policy will be treated seriously and may result in disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal.\n*   The Board will receive regular reports from the MLRO and MLCO on the operation and effectiveness of the AML/CFT framework.\n\n## 7.

The capital ratio (Capital / Risk-Weighted Assets) will be monitored daily and reported to Senior Management weekly and to the Governance Committee monthly.\n\n### 5.2 Liquidity & Reserve Management for Fiat-Backed Stablecoins\n1.  **Reserve Composition:** The reserve for fiat-backed stablecoins shall consist exclusively of:\n    *   Cash deposits held in segregated accounts at regulated banks.\n    *   Short-term government securities (e.g., T-Bills) with minimal credit and market risk.\n    *   Other assets as may be explicitly permitted by the JFSC.\n2.  **Custody:** All reserve assets must be held under a clear segregation of assets framework with a Regulated Custodian. The custodian agreement must prohibit commingling of reserve assets with the entity's operational funds or the custodian's own assets.\n3.  **Reserve Adequacy:** The Treasury Department must ensure the total fair market value of the reserve assets equals or exceeds the total face value of outstanding stablecoins at the close of each business day. Automated systems will provide intraday monitoring.\n4.  **Redemption Process:** A robust operational procedure will be maintained to ensure redemption requests from verified holders are processed within the service level agreement (SLA), utilizing the liquid reserve assets.\n\n### 5.3 Independent Verification\n1.  **Frequency:** At a minimum, the composition and value of the fiat-backed stablecoin reserve will be subject to an independent third-party attestation **monthly**.\n2.  **Reporting:** A summary of the attestation report, confirming the 1:1 reserve ratio, will be published on the entity's website within 10 business days of the report's completion. Full reports will be provided to the JFSC as required.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n\n*   All personnel must adhere to the procedures outlined in this policy.\n*   The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) are jointly responsible for the implementation and day-to-day adherence to this policy.\n*   The Governance Committee is responsible for oversight, reviewing policy exceptions, and ensuring Board-level accountability.\n*   Any breach of capital or liquidity limits must be escalated immediately to the CRO, CFO, and Governance Committee. A corrective action plan must be formulated within 24 hours.\n*   Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule\n\nThis policy shall be reviewed:\n*   **Annually** by the Risk Department and the Governance Committee to ensure its continued effectiveness and relevance.\n*   **Immediately** following any material change in the entity's business model, risk profile, or applicable regulations (specifically those issued by the JFSC).\nAll revisions require approval by the Governance Committee and the Board of Directors.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements\n\nThis policy is designed to ensure compliance with, but not limited to, the following regulatory principles and requirements:\n*   **JFSC's Principles for Regulation:** Specifically, the principles relating to financial resilience, safeguarding client assets, and transparency.\n*   **JFSC Stablecoin Regime:** Adherence to the specific rules governing fiat-backed stablecoin issuers, including but not limited to:\n    *   The requirement for a 1:1 backing with appropriate liquid assets.\n    *   The segregation and custody requirements for reserve assets.\n    *   The frequency and transparency of reserve reporting and independent assurance.\n*   **Basel Framework (Referential):** The risk-based capital methodology is informed by the standards of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, scaled appropriately for the entity's size and complexity.\n```"

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Jersey\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-02-11T20:53:26.574313\n\n## Executive Summary\nOverall compliance status is NON-COMPLIANT. The analysis reveals a fundamental and critical absence of any documented policies or frameworks necessary to operate a stablecoin service in Jersey. The company is exposed to severe legal, financial, and reputational risks. Immediate action is required to: 1) Halt any Jersey-facing operations, 2) Engage with the JFSC, and 3) Develop a complete compliance program from the ground up before seeking authorization. All identified gaps are Critical or High priority due to the total lack of foundational controls.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Jersey's regulatory framework for stablecoins requires authorization under the Financial Services (Jersey) Law 1998 for issuance, custody, or exchange activities. This includes requirements for governance, risk management, capital adequacy, and consumer protection.\n\n**Current Status:** No company policies provided for analysis. This indicates a complete absence of documented policies, procedures, or controls related to stablecoin operations in Jersey.\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of a documented compliance framework. The company lacks any policies addressing authorization requirements, governance structures, risk management, capital, consumer protection, or operational standards mandated for stablecoin activities in Jersey.\n\n**Impact:** Operating without authorization is illegal and carries severe penalties, including fines, license revocation, and criminal liability for directors. It exposes the company to immediate regulatory enforcement action, reputational destruction, and loss of customer trust.\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Immediately cease any stablecoin-related activities in/into Jersey until compliance is established. 2. Engage with the Jersey Financial Services Commission (JFSC) to understand the specific authorization pathway (e.g., as a Money Service Business, Digital Asset Service Provider). 3. Develop a comprehensive compliance policy framework covering governance, risk management, capital, custody, redemption, disclosures, and AML/CFT before applying for authorization.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Adherence to Jersey's Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) regime, primarily the Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999 and the Money Laundering (Jersey) Order 2008. This requires robust Customer Due Diligence (CDD), transaction monitoring, reporting of suspicious activity, and record-keeping.\n\n**Current Status:** No AML/CFT policies or procedures documented.\n\n**Gap:** No framework exists to identify customers, monitor transactions, report suspicious activity, or maintain required records. This is a fundamental failure for any financial service in Jersey.\n\n**Impact:** High risk of facilitating money laundering or terrorist financing. Will result in significant regulatory sanctions, potential criminal prosecution, and inability to establish banking relationships.\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop and implement a Jersey-specific AML/CFT Policy and Procedures Manual. Appoint a Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO) and a Money Laundering Compliance Officer (MLCO). Integrate CDD/KYC processes, risk-based transaction monitoring systems, and clear reporting lines to the JFSC and Jersey's Financial Intelligence Unit.\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Requirement for clear, fair, and non-misleading disclosures to consumers regarding the nature of the stablecoin, its stabilization mechanism, associated risks, redemption rights, and fees.\n\n**Recommendation:** Create comprehensive disclosure documents and marketing standards that clearly explain: the stabilization mechanism (e.g., fiat-backed, algorithmic), custody arrangements, redemption process, all risks (e.g., de-pegging, counterparty, regulatory), and all fees. Ensure these are presented to customers prior to transaction.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Prudential requirements, including capital adequacy and liquidity management, to ensure the entity can meet its obligations, particularly redemption requests.\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop a Capital Adequacy and Liquidity Management Policy. Define and implement a risk-based capital requirement. For fiat-backed stablecoins, ensure a 1:1 liquid asset reserve (or as per JFSC specification) held with a regulated custodian, with frequent attestations or audits.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Governance and risk management frameworks, including defined roles and responsibilities for the Board, senior management, and compliance functions.\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish a formal Governance Framework document outlining Board composition, committees, and duties. Develop a Risk Management Framework that includes a risk taxonomy, assessment methodology, and mitigation strategies. Formally appoint a Head of Compliance with direct reporting lines to the Board.\n\n### Gap 4: GAP-006\n**Requirement:** Operational resilience and technology risk management, including cybersecurity measures, custody solutions for reserve assets, and business continuity planning.\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement a Cybersecurity Policy aligned with standards like ISO 27001 or NIST. Establish a robust Custody Policy for reserve assets, preferably using regulated third-party custodians. Develop and test a Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plan.\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **Regulatory Authorization & Licensing**: not_met\n❌ **AML/CFT Compliance**: not_met\n❌ **Consumer Disclosures**: not_met\n❌ **Prudential Requirements (Capital/Liquidity)**: not_met\n❌ **Governance & Risk Management**: not_met\n❌ **Operational Resilience & Technology**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update Summary\nGenerated: 2026-02-11T20:54:03.729060\n\n## Overview\nThis document summarizes proposed updates to company policies and standards based on regulatory gap analysis.\n\n## New Policies Required\n\n## Modified Policies\n\n### GAP-001\n**Category:** Data Protection\n**Current Policy:** No company policies provided for analysis. This indicates a complete absence of documented policies, procedures, or controls related to stablecoin operations in Jersey.\n**Proposed Change:** 1. Immediately cease any stablecoin-related activities in/into Jersey until compliance is established. 2. Engage with the Jersey Financial Services Commission (JFSC) to understand the specific authorization pathway (e.g., as a Money Service Business, Digital Asset Service Provider). 3. Develop a comprehensive compliance policy framework covering governance, risk management, capital, custody, redemption, disclosures, and AML/CFT before applying for authorization.\n\n### GAP-002\n**Category:** AML/KYC\n**Current Policy:** No AML/CFT policies or procedures documented.\n**Proposed Change:** Develop and implement a Jersey-specific AML/CFT Policy and Procedures Manual. Appoint a Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO) and a Money Laundering Compliance Officer (MLCO). Integrate CDD/KYC processes, risk-based transaction monitoring systems, and clear reporting lines to the JFSC and Jersey's Financial Intelligence Unit.\n\n### GAP-003\n**Category:** Risk Management\n**Current Policy:** No documented disclosure policies, terms of service, or customer communications protocols.\n**Proposed Change:** Create comprehensive disclosure documents and marketing standards that clearly explain: the stabilization mechanism (e.g., fiat-backed, algorithmic), custody arrangements, redemption process, all risks (e.g., de-pegging, counterparty, regulatory), and all fees. Ensure these are presented to customers prior to transaction.\n\n### GAP-004\n**Category:** Risk Management\n**Current Policy:** No documented capital, reserve, or liquidity management policies.\n**Proposed Change:** Develop a Capital Adequacy and Liquidity Management Policy. Define and implement a risk-based capital requirement. For fiat-backed stablecoins, ensure a 1:1 liquid asset reserve (or as per JFSC specification) held with a regulated custodian, with frequent attestations or audits.\n\n### GAP-005\n**Category:** Risk Management\n**Current Policy:** No documented governance charter, risk management framework, or compliance function.\n**Proposed Change:** Establish a formal Governance Framework document outlining Board composition, committees, and duties.
