This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Mauritania\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-02-06T01:11:11.743646\n\n## Executive Summary\nCRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company has no existing policies for stablecoin operations in Mauritania, representing a complete regulatory compliance gap. All fundamental regulatory requirements for financial services, digital assets, and stablecoin operations are unaddressed. Immediate action is required to develop comprehensive policies before any operations can commence in Mauritania. The highest priority gaps relate to legal authorization, AML/CTF compliance, and consumer protection. Given the limited regulatory research available, engaging local legal counsel is essential to obtain accurate interpretation of Mauritanian financial regulations and any specific stablecoin guidance that may exist or be under development.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Legal framework for stablecoin issuance and operation in Mauritania\n\n**Current Status:** No company policies exist for stablecoin operations\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing stablecoin regulatory requirements in Mauritania.

Could trigger international sanctions compliance issues.\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive AML/CTF policies for stablecoin operations including: 1) Customer identification and verification procedures, 2) Transaction monitoring systems, 3) Suspicious activity reporting protocols, 4) Record retention requirements meeting Mauritanian standards.\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements\n\n**Recommendation:** Create consumer protection framework including: 1) Clear risk disclosure documents in Arabic and French, 2) Transparent redemption policies, 3) Reserve audit and reporting procedures, 4) Customer complaint handling system compliant with Mauritanian consumer protection laws.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Reserve management and auditing requirements\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish comprehensive reserve management policy including: 1) Minimum reserve requirements and composition standards, 2) Qualified custodian arrangements, 3) Liquidity management procedures, 4) Regular independent audit requirements with public reporting.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop operational risk framework including: 1) Cybersecurity standards for wallet and platform security, 2) Smart contract audit requirements, 3) Key management and recovery procedures, 4) Business continuity and disaster recovery plans specific to stablecoin operations.\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **legal_framework_for_stablecoins**: not_met\n❌ **aml_ctf_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **consumer_protection**: not_met\n❌ **reserve_management**: not_met\n❌ **operational_risk_management**: not_met\n❌ **reporting_and_supervision**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update Summary\nGenerated: 2026-02-06T01:11:49.906964\n\n## Overview\nThis document summarizes proposed updates to company policies and standards based on regulatory gap analysis.\n\n## New Policies Required\n\n## Modified Policies\n\n### GAP-001\n**Category:** Legal\n**Current Policy:** No company policies exist for stablecoin operations\n**Proposed Change:** Immediately suspend any stablecoin operations in Mauritania until comprehensive policies are developed.
