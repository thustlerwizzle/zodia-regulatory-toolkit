# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-12T17:35:40.776376

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no documented policies addressing stablecoin regulatory requirements. This represents a complete compliance failure across all major regulatory domains. Immediate action is required to develop comprehensive policies and obtain necessary licenses before any stablecoin operations can commence. The company is currently non-compliant with EU/Portuguese financial regulations and would face immediate enforcement action if operating. Priority must be given to licensing, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance as these represent existential risks to the business.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must maintain 1:1 reserves in high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) with regular independent audits

**Current Status:** No documented reserve management or audit policy

**Gap:** Complete absence of reserve management framework, custody arrangements, or audit procedures required for stablecoin issuance

**Impact:** Regulatory enforcement actions, license revocation, criminal liability for misrepresentation, loss of customer trust, potential insolvency

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive reserve management policy including: 1) Segregated custody arrangements with qualified custodians 2) Monthly attestations and quarterly independent audits 3) Public disclosure of reserve composition 4) Liquidity stress testing procedures

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance including KYC, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT program

**Gap:** Missing entire AML/CFT framework required for financial services involving stablecoins

**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, criminal prosecution, inability to access banking services, reputational damage

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive AML/CFT program including: 1) Risk-based customer due diligence 2) Transaction monitoring system 3) Suspicious activity reporting procedures 4) Designated compliance officer 5) Regular employee training

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Licensing and registration requirements for stablecoin issuance and related financial services

**Current Status:** No documented licensing strategy or regulatory engagement plan

**Gap:** Unclear regulatory status and missing licensing applications for stablecoin operations

**Impact:** Operating without required licenses, immediate regulatory shutdown, criminal charges for unlicensed financial services

**Recommendation:** Conduct jurisdictional analysis and apply for necessary licenses before operations begin. Engage legal counsel to determine specific Azores/Portuguese/EU licensing requirements

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling

**Recommendation:** Develop consumer protection framework including: 1) Clear redemption policy with timelines 2) Comprehensive risk disclosures 3) Complaint handling procedures 4) Data protection and privacy measures

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Operational risk management including cybersecurity, business continuity, and third-party risk management

**Recommendation:** Establish operational risk management program including: 1) Cybersecurity framework (NIST/ISO) 2) Business continuity and disaster recovery plans 3) Third-party vendor risk management 4) Incident response procedures
