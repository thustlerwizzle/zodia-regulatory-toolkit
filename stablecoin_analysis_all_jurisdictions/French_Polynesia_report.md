## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no documented policies addressing stablecoin regulatory requirements in French Polynesia. This represents a complete regulatory compliance gap across all essential areas including licensing, AML/CTF, consumer protection, and reserve management. Immediate action is required to: 1) Conduct comprehensive regulatory research on French Polynesia's specific requirements, 2) Develop foundational compliance policies, and 3) Engage local legal counsel. The company should consider suspending any stablecoin operations in French Polynesia until basic compliance frameworks are established to avoid severe regulatory consequences.
