This represents a complete regulatory gap with severe operational and legal risks. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive regulatory compliance framework before commencing any stablecoin operations. The highest priority gaps relate to licensing, AML/CTF compliance, and consumer protection, which are typically the focus of financial regulators in the West African region. Given the limited regulatory research results, the company must urgently conduct proper regulatory due diligence specific to Benin's implementation of WAEMU/BCEAO regulations regarding digital currencies."

Policy Title  \nLegal Authorization and Licensing Policy for Stablecoin Operations in Benin\n\n## 2. Purpose and Scope  \n**Purpose:**  \nThis policy establishes a structured framework to ensure that all stablecoin issuance and service provision activities conducted by or on behalf of our organization in the Republic of Benin are fully compliant with applicable national laws and regulatory requirements. The policy aims to mitigate legal, operational, and reputational risks by mandating proactive engagement with legal experts to secure necessary authorizations before any operational commencement.\n\n**Scope:**  \nThis policy applies to all departments, subsidiaries, contractors, and partners involved in or supporting the following activities within Benin:\n- Issuance, distribution, or redemption of stablecoins.\n- Provision of services related to stablecoin exchange, transfer, custody, or wallet management.\n- Marketing, sales, or business development targeting Beninese users or markets for stablecoin-related products.\n- Any strategic initiative exploring entry into the Beninian digital currency market.\n\n## 3. Definitions  \n- **Stablecoin:** A type of digital currency designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified asset or a pool of assets (e.g., fiat currency, commodities).\n- **Licensing Authority:** The designated regulatory body or government institution in Benin empowered to authorize, license, or supervise digital currency operations.\n- **Legal Counsel:** A qualified law firm or legal practitioner(s) licensed to practice in Benin, with demonstrable expertise in financial regulation, digital assets, and/or fintech.\n- **Operational Commencement:** The initiation of any public-facing activity, including testing with external users, marketing campaigns, or transactional operations within Benin.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement  \nIt is the policy of this organization that no stablecoin-related operations shall be conducted in the Republic of Benin without first obtaining all required legal authorizations, licenses, or registrations from the competent Beninese authorities. Given the absence of a documented internal understanding of these requirements, the organization mandates immediate and proactive legal research and strategic planning as the foundational step toward compliance. All personnel are required to adhere to the procedures outlined herein to achieve and maintain full regulatory compliance.\n\n## 5. Procedures  \n\n### Phase 1: Immediate Legal Engagement (Initiate within 5 business days of policy adoption)\n1. **Selection of Legal Counsel:**  \n   The General Counsel (or designated officer) shall identify and retain qualified Legal Counsel with specific expertise in Beninese financial and digital asset regulation.\n2. **Scope of Work Definition:**  \n   Legal Counsel shall be formally engaged with a mandate to:\n   a. Conduct comprehensive research into Benin's existing legal and regulatory framework governing digital currencies, electronic money, payment services, securities, and anti-money laundering (AML).\n   b. Identify the specific Licensing Authority(ies) for stablecoin activities.\n   c. Detail all licensing, registration, or authorization requirements, including:\n      - Application forms and processes.\n      - Eligibility criteria (e.g., capital requirements, corporate structure, fit-and-proper tests for management).\n      - Ongoing operational conditions (e.g., reporting, auditing, consumer protection, AML/CFT obligations).\n      - Associated timelines and fees.\n\n### Phase 2: Strategy Development & Internal Review\n1. **Reporting:** Legal Counsel shall present a formal written report of findings and recommendations to the Executive Leadership Team and Compliance Department.\n2. **Application Strategy Development:** Based on the legal report, a cross-functional team (Legal, Compliance, Product, Finance) shall develop a detailed Licensing Application Strategy. This strategy will include:\n   a. A roadmap and timeline for application submission.\n   b. Resource allocation and responsibilities.\n   c. A gap analysis comparing current organizational status against requirements.\n   d. A risk mitigation plan for the pre-licensing period.\n\n### Phase 3: Application Execution & Pre-Launch Compliance\n1. **Implementation:** Execute the Licensing Application Strategy under the supervision of Legal Counsel.\n2. **Pre-Launch Controls:** Until formal authorization is granted, all public-facing activities in Benin are strictly prohibited. Internal development and planning may continue but must be clearly segregated from any operational launch.\n3. **Communication:** All engagement with Beninese regulators shall be coordinated exclusively through or with the explicit approval of the designated Legal Counsel and the Head of Compliance.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements  \n- **Mandatory Adherence:** All employees and contractors must comply with this policy. Violations may result in disciplinary action.\n- **Certification:** The Head of Compliance must certify quarterly to the Board of Directors that no stablecoin operations have commenced in Benin without the required licenses and that the procedures under this policy are being followed.\n- **Documentation:** All research reports, correspondence with regulators, application materials, and legal opinions shall be meticulously documented and archived in a secure central repository.\n- **Non-Circumvention:** It is strictly prohibited to attempt to offer services in Benin through technological or contractual structures designed to circumvent the intent of Beninese regulation.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule  \nThis policy shall be reviewed and potentially updated:\n- **Annually** as part of the standard compliance policy review cycle.\n- **Immediately** upon any material change in Beninese digital currency regulation.\n- **Upon receipt** of a license or formal regulatory feedback, to transition from an application-focused to an operational compliance policy.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements  \nThis policy is enacted in direct response to the identified regulatory requirement for **Legal authorization/licensing for stablecoin issuance or service provision in Benin**. The specific statutes, regulations, and regulatory guidelines will be detailed in the report produced by the engaged Legal Counsel (Phase 1). Pending that report, this policy references the overarching obligation to operate within the legal framework of Benin, including but not limited to potential areas of law such as:\n- Financial and Monetary Code of Benin.\n- Regulations issued by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) applicable in Benin.\n- Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) laws.\n- Electronic transaction and data protection laws.\n- Consumer protection regulations.\n\n*Policy Effective Date: [Date of Board Approval]*  \n*Policy Owner: General Counsel / Chief Compliance Officer*  \n*Approved By: [Signature of CEO/Board Chair]*\n```"

This represents a complete regulatory gap with severe operational and legal risks. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive regulatory compliance framework before commencing any stablecoin operations. The highest priority gaps relate to licensing, AML/CTF compliance, and consumer protection, which are typically the focus of financial regulators in the West African region. Given the limited regulatory research results, the company must urgently conduct proper regulatory due diligence specific to Benin's implementation of WAEMU/BCEAO regulations regarding digital currencies.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Legal authorization/licensing for stablecoin issuance or service provision in Benin\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found regarding licensing requirements for stablecoin operations\n\n**Gap:** Company lacks policies addressing the need for formal authorization from Benin's financial regulators (potentially the Central Bank of West African States -
