# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-31T00:27:50.946328

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits a complete absence of documented policies and procedures required for stablecoin operations under Icelandic/EU regulations. Based on the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation applicable in Iceland through EU membership, all critical regulatory requirements are currently unmet. The company is operating in a state of severe non-compliance with no foundational compliance infrastructure. Immediate action is required to develop comprehensive policies across all regulatory domains, with priority given to authorization/licensing, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance. Without rapid remediation, the company faces significant regulatory, operational, and reputational risks that could threaten its continued operations.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Authorization/Licensing for stablecoin issuance and services (based on EU MiCA framework applicable in Iceland)

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** Company lacks any documented policies regarding authorization requirements for stablecoin issuance, custody, or exchange services under Icelandic/EU regulations

**Impact:** Operating without proper authorization could result in regulatory enforcement actions, fines, license revocation, and reputational damage

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive licensing and authorization policy aligned with MiCA requirements, including application procedures, capital requirements, and governance standards

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Reserve asset management and segregation requirements for stablecoin issuers

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** No policies exist for managing reserve assets, maintaining adequate liquidity, or segregating customer funds as required by stablecoin regulations

**Impact:** Failure to maintain proper reserves could lead to stablecoin depegging, consumer losses, regulatory sanctions, and loss of market confidence

**Recommendation:** Create reserve management policy detailing asset composition, custody arrangements, regular attestations/audits, and segregation requirements

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance for virtual asset service providers (VASPs)

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** Complete absence of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing policies required for stablecoin service providers

**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties, potential criminal liability, loss of banking relationships, and exclusion from financial system

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive AML/CFT program including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and record-keeping procedures

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements

**Recommendation:** Develop consumer protection framework including clear terms of service, risk disclosures, redemption procedures, and complaint resolution mechanisms

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity requirements

**Recommendation:** Establish comprehensive operational resilience framework including cybersecurity protocols, business continuity plans, and incident response procedures

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Governance and risk management framework

**Recommendation:** Implement formal governance framework including board oversight, risk management committee, internal audit function, and compliance monitoring
