All fundamental regulatory requirements for stablecoin issuers are unmet. Immediate action is required to establish basic compliance frameworks before any operational activities can commence. The highest priority gaps relate to licensing, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance, which are typically prerequisites for regulatory approval. The company should suspend all stablecoin-related activities until these critical gaps are addressed and engage with Montserrat's Financial Services Commission for specific regulatory guidance."

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Montserrat\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-02-12T13:32:34.528934\n\n## Executive Summary\nCRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no documented policies for stablecoin operations in Montserrat, representing a complete regulatory compliance gap. All fundamental regulatory requirements for stablecoin issuers are unmet. Immediate action is required to establish basic compliance frameworks before any operational activities can commence. The highest priority gaps relate to licensing, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance, which are typically prerequisites for regulatory approval. The company should suspend all stablecoin-related activities until these critical gaps are addressed and engage with Montserrat's Financial Services Commission for specific regulatory guidance.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuer licensing requirement - Montserrat likely requires stablecoin issuers to obtain specific authorization or licensing from the Financial Services Commission (FSC) Montserrat\n\n**Current Status:** No documented licensing policy or application process\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of licensing framework and application procedures for stablecoin issuance in Montserrat jurisdiction\n\n**Impact:** Legal prohibition from operating, potential regulatory enforcement actions, fines, and reputational damage\n\n**Recommendation:** Immediately engage with Montserrat FSC to understand licensing requirements and initiate application process\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Reserve asset requirements - Stablecoin issuers typically must maintain high-quality liquid assets backing the stablecoin at 1:1 ratio or as specified by regulator\n\n**Current Status:** No reserve management policy documented\n\n**Gap:** Missing policies for reserve composition, custody, auditing, and regular reporting of reserve assets\n\n**Impact:** Regulatory non-compliance, loss of consumer confidence, potential insolvency risks, and enforcement actions\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive reserve management policy including asset types, custody arrangements, audit requirements, and reporting protocols\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance - Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing requirements including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting\n\n**Current Status:** No AML/CFT policies documented for stablecoin operations\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of AML/CFT framework specific to stablecoin transactions and customer onboarding\n\n**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, loss of banking relationships, potential criminal liability, and business shutdown\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive AML/CFT program including KYC procedures, transaction monitoring systems, and SAR reporting mechanisms\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures - Requirements for disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling procedures\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish consumer protection framework including clear terms of service, redemption policies, and complaint resolution procedures\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Operational risk management - Requirements for cybersecurity, business continuity, and operational resilience\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive operational risk management framework including cybersecurity standards, incident response plans, and business continuity procedures\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-006\n**Requirement:** Governance and oversight - Requirements for board oversight, risk committees, and internal controls\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish clear governance structure with board oversight, dedicated risk committee, and comprehensive internal controls\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **licensing_requirements**: not_met\n❌ **reserve_requirements**: not_met\n❌ **aml_cft_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **consumer_protection**: not_met\n❌ **operational_risk**: not_met\n❌ **governance_oversight**: not_met\n❌ **reporting_transparency**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update Summary\nGenerated: 2026-02-12T13:33:14.375649\n\n## Overview\nThis document summarizes proposed updates to company policies and standards based on regulatory gap analysis.\n\n## New Policies Required\n\n## Modified Policies\n\n### GAP-001\n**Category:** Compliance\n**Current Policy:** No documented licensing policy or application process\n**Proposed Change:** Immediately engage with Montserrat FSC to understand licensing requirements and initiate application process\n\n### GAP-002\n**Category:** Compliance\n**Current Policy:** No reserve management policy documented\n**Proposed Change:** Develop comprehensive reserve management policy including asset types, custody arrangements, audit requirements, and reporting protocols\n\n### GAP-003\n**Category:** AML/KYC\n**Current Policy:** No AML/CFT policies documented for stablecoin operations\n**Proposed Change:** Implement comprehensive AML/CFT program including KYC procedures, transaction monitoring systems, and SAR reporting mechanisms\n\n### GAP-004\n**Category:** Data Protection\n**Current Policy:** No consumer protection policies documented\n**Proposed Change:** Establish consumer protection framework including clear terms of service, redemption policies, and complaint resolution procedures\n\n### GAP-005\n**Category:** Risk Management\n**Current Policy:** No documented operational risk policies for stablecoin operations\n**Proposed Change:** Develop comprehensive operational risk management framework including cybersecurity standards, incident response plans, and business continuity procedures\n\n### GAP-006\n**Category:** Risk Management\n**Current Policy:** No governance framework documented for stablecoin operations\n**Proposed Change:** Establish clear governance structure with board oversight, dedicated risk committee, and comprehensive internal controls\n\n### GAP-007\n**Category:** Compliance\n**Current Policy:** No reporting or disclosure policies documented\n**Proposed Change:** Develop reporting framework including regulatory filings, public disclosures, and transparency reports\n\n\n\n## Policy Implementation\n\n✅ **Automatically implemented 7 policies**\n\n📁 **Saved to:** C:\\Users\\takun\\Desktop\\Regulatory_Policies\n\n📄 **Summary file:** C:\\Users\\takun\\Desktop\\Regulatory_Policies\\IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md\n\n\n### Implemented Policies:\n\n- **GAP-001** (Compliance) -
