# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-31T05:54:35.037676

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits comprehensive non-compliance with EU and Italian stablecoin regulations, primarily under the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) Regulation. No policies currently address the core regulatory requirements for stablecoin issuance and operation. Critical gaps exist in licensing, reserve management, and consumer protection areas that must be addressed immediately to avoid severe regulatory consequences. The company should prioritize obtaining regulatory guidance, developing a comprehensive compliance program, and seeking legal counsel specializing in EU crypto-asset regulations before proceeding with any stablecoin-related activities. Given the complete absence of relevant policies, the compliance maturity level is foundational, requiring substantial investment in compliance infrastructure and expertise.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Registration/Licensing for stablecoin issuers under EU MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) Regulation

**Current Status:** No documented policy for stablecoin issuance or regulatory registration

**Gap:** Company lacks policies addressing the mandatory EU authorization/licensing requirements for stablecoin issuers. MiCA requires issuers of significant asset-referenced tokens (ARTs) and e-money tokens (EMTs) to obtain authorization from competent authorities.

**Impact:** Operating without proper authorization could result in regulatory enforcement actions, significant fines (up to 10% of annual turnover under MiCA), cessation of operations, and reputational damage.

**Recommendation:** 1. Immediately assess whether company activities fall under MiCA's scope for stablecoin issuance. 2. Develop a licensing/registration policy outlining the authorization process with EU/Italian authorities. 3. Designate a compliance officer to manage the authorization application process.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Reserve asset requirements and custody arrangements for stablecoins

**Current Status:** No documented reserve management or custody policies

**Gap:** MiCA mandates strict requirements for reserve assets backing stablecoins, including composition, segregation, custody, and regular independent audits. No policies exist to ensure reserve assets are held in secure custody with reputable institutions.

**Impact:** Failure to properly manage reserve assets could lead to insufficient backing for stablecoins, loss of customer funds, regulatory sanctions, and loss of market confidence triggering a run on the stablecoin.

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop a comprehensive reserve management policy specifying eligible assets, diversification requirements, and custody arrangements. 2. Establish procedures for daily valuation and monthly reconciliation of reserves. 3. Implement arrangements for independent reserve audits at least annually.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Transparency and disclosure obligations for stablecoin issuers

**Recommendation:** 1. Create a disclosure policy outlining all required MiCA disclosures. 2. Develop templates for whitepapers, terms of service, and regular reporting. 3. Implement procedures for maintaining a public website with current disclosure information.

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance for stablecoin transactions

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop stablecoin-specific AML/CFT policies addressing transaction monitoring, KYC/CDD, and suspicious activity reporting. 2. Implement blockchain analytics tools for monitoring stablecoin transactions. 3. Establish procedures for reporting to Italian Financial Intelligence Unit (UIF).

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and redemption rights

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop a redemption policy guaranteeing holders' rights to redeem at par value. 2. Establish clear procedures for redemption requests and timelines. 3. Create a consumer complaint handling framework with escalation procedures.
