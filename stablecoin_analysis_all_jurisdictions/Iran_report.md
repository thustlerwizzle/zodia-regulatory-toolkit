# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-31T00:40:26.559920

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE FAILURE: The company has no policies addressing Iranian stablecoin regulations, representing a complete regulatory gap. All regulatory requirements are unmet. Immediate action is required to suspend operations and develop comprehensive policies before considering any activity in Iran. The situation is particularly complex due to conflicts between Iranian regulations and international sanctions regimes. Priority should be given to legal risk assessment and policy development before any operational decisions.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Iran has comprehensive cryptocurrency regulations under the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) and the Ministry of Information and Communications Technology (ICT). Stablecoins are treated as cryptocurrencies and subject to licensing, AML/CFT requirements, and operational restrictions.

**Current Status:** No company policies found for stablecoin operations in Iran

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing Iranian regulatory requirements for stablecoin issuance, trading, or custody

**Impact:** Severe legal and financial risks including criminal penalties, asset seizure, business shutdown, and executive liability

**Recommendation:** Immediately suspend all stablecoin operations in Iran until comprehensive policies are developed and approved. Engage Iranian legal counsel to interpret local regulations and draft compliant policies.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Mandatory licensing from Central Bank of Iran for cryptocurrency operations including stablecoins

**Current Status:** No licensing policy or procedure

**Gap:** No policy addressing licensing requirements, application processes, or ongoing license maintenance

**Impact:** Operating without required license constitutes illegal activity with severe penalties

**Recommendation:** Develop licensing policy including: 1) License requirement assessment, 2) Application procedures, 3) Compliance monitoring, 4) Renewal processes

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and reporting to Iranian Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU)

**Current Status:** No Iran-specific AML/CFT policies

**Gap:** Lack of policies addressing Iran's specific AML/CFT requirements which differ from international standards

**Impact:** Criminal liability for money laundering violations, substantial fines, and reputational damage

**Recommendation:** Create Iran-specific AML/CFT policy aligned with CBI requirements, including: 1) Enhanced KYC for Iranian customers, 2) Local transaction monitoring, 3) FIU reporting procedures

### Gap 4: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Sanctions compliance given Iran's international sanctions status

**Current Status:** No Iran-specific sanctions compliance policy

**Gap:** Lack of policies addressing dual compliance with Iranian regulations and international sanctions regimes

**Impact:** Simultaneous violation of Iranian law and international sanctions with severe multi-jurisdictional penalties

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive sanctions compliance policy including: 1) Conflict resolution framework, 2) Dual compliance assessment, 3) Escalation procedures, 4) Exit strategy planning

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Data localization and privacy requirements under Iranian law

**Recommendation:** Develop data governance policy for Iran including: 1) Data localization requirements, 2) Privacy protections, 3) Government access protocols, 4) Cross-border data transfer restrictions

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational requirements including capital adequacy, reserve requirements for stablecoin issuers, and technical standards

**Recommendation:** Establish operational policy framework covering: 1) Capital requirements, 2) Reserve management and auditing, 3) Technical compliance standards, 4) Risk management protocols
