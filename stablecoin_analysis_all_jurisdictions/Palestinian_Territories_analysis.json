Purpose and Scope\n\n### 1.1 Purpose\nThis policy establishes the foundational legal and procedural framework for the issuance, operation, governance, and oversight of stablecoins within the Palestinian Territories. Its primary purpose is to provide legal clarity, mitigate systemic risks, protect consumers, and ensure compliance with existing and emerging national and international financial regulations, thereby fostering a secure and innovative digital asset ecosystem.\n\n### 1.2 Scope\nThis policy applies to:\n*   All entities seeking to issue, redeem, manage, or provide critical services for stablecoins pegged to any fiat currency (including but not limited to the Israeli Shekel, Jordanian Dinar, US Dollar, or a theoretical Palestinian currency) and operating within the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Territories.\n*   Any natural or legal person engaging in activities defined as \"Stablecoin-Related Activities\" within the Palestinian Territories.\n*   This policy is an interim foundational document. It will guide initial engagements and shape the development of more detailed regulations, which may be issued by a future formal financial regulatory authority.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Definitions\n\n*   **Applicant:** Any entity seeking formal approval or a license to conduct Stablecoin-Related Activities.\n*   **Backing Assets:** The low-risk, high-liquidity reserve assets (e.g., cash, cash equivalents, short-term government securities) held to fully back the value of issued stablecoins.\n*   **Custodian:** A regulated financial institution responsible for the safekeeping and segregation of Backing Assets.\n*   **Issuer:** The legal entity that creates and issues stablecoins, holds the corresponding Backing Assets, and manages redemption.\n*   **Palestinian Financial Regulations:** The body of laws, decrees, and regulations governing financial activities, including but not limited to those issued by the Palestinian Monetary Authority (PMA), Capital Market Authority, and anti-money laundering statutes.\n*   **Stablecoin:** A type of digital asset designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified fiat currency or basket of assets.\n*   **Stablecoin-Related Activities:** Issuance, redemption, exchange, transfer, custody, wallet provision, and any other service integral to the stablecoin lifecycle.\n*   **Wallet Provider:** An entity that provides software or hardware for users to store, send, and receive stablecoins.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Policy Statement\n\nIt is the policy of the relevant Palestinian authorities that any Stablecoin-Related Activity conducted within its jurisdiction must operate within a clear, risk-proportionate legal and regulatory framework. Until formal licensing regimes are established, no entity may represent itself as a licensed or officially authorized stablecoin issuer or service provider without explicit written approval granted through the procedures outlined herein. All activities must adhere to the core principles of legality, transparency, consumer protection, financial integrity, and systemic stability.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Procedures\n\n### Phase 1: Foundational Research and Engagement (Months 1-4)\n1.  **Legal Landscape Analysis:** A dedicated team shall commission and oversee comprehensive research into existing Palestinian Financial Regulations, including banking, payments, securities, anti-money laundering (AML), counter-financing of terrorism (CFT), and consumer protection laws. Gaps and applicability to digital assets will be identified.\n2.  **Expert Counsel Retention:** The team shall engage one or more reputable local legal firms with demonstrated expertise in financial technology and Palestinian commercial/financial law to interpret findings and advise on policy development.\n3.  **Stakeholder Consultation:** Draft findings and proposals shall be shared for confidential consultation with key stakeholders, including selected financial institutions, technology experts, and civil society representatives.\n\n### Phase 2: Interim Approval Pathway (Months 5-8)\n1.  **Expression of Interest (EOI):** Entities wishing to explore stablecoin issuance must first submit a formal EOI to the designated interim regulatory contact point ([Designated Office/Committee]).\n2.  **Pre-Application Dialogue:** Following EOI review, selected Applicants will be invited into a structured dialogue. They must present:\n    *   A detailed legal opinion from retained Palestinian counsel on the regulatory classification of their proposed stablecoin.\n    *   A comprehensive business plan, including governance structure, detailed redemption mechanics, and custody arrangements for Backing Assets.\n    *   A full risk assessment (operational, financial, AML/CFT).\n3.  **Conditional Approval-in-Principle:** Based on the dialogue, the authority may grant a written \"Conditional Approval-in-Principle,\" which is not a license but an agreement on the regulatory path forward and key requirements.\n\n### Phase 3: Policy Formalization & Future Licensing Framework (Months 9-12+)\n1.  Based on Phase 1 research and Phase 2 dialogues, a detailed draft regulation for stablecoins will be developed, specifying capital requirements, licensing tiers, audit mandates, reporting standards, and operational rules.\n2.  This draft will be submitted to the relevant legislative or executive bodies for enactment into formal law or regulation.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Compliance Requirements\n\nAll entities engaged in Stablecoin-Related Activities, even prior to a formal license, must adhere to the following core requirements:\n\n*   **Legal Status:** Entities must be legally registered in a recognized jurisdiction and disclose their corporate structure.\n*   **Transparency & Disclosure:** Publicly publish a detailed white paper or terms of service clearly explaining the stablecoin’s mechanism, redemption rights, risks, and the audit status of Backing Assets.\n*   **Asset Backing & Custody:** Maintain 1:1 backing with segregated, high-quality Backing Assets. Custody must be with a qualified, regulated third-party custodian subject to regular attestations (at minimum quarterly) by an independent auditor.\n*   **AML/CFT Compliance:** Implement a risk-based AML/CFT program consistent with Palestinian law and FATF recommendations, including KYC, transaction monitoring, and reporting of suspicious activities.\n*   **Consumer Redemption:** Guarantee a clear, timely, and low-fee redemption process for stablecoin holders to the referenced fiat currency.\n*   **Prohibited Activities:**\n    *   Issuing stablecoins without full transparency of backing.\n    *   Engaging in fractional reserve issuance without explicit banking authorization.\n    *   Misrepresenting regulatory status.\n    *   Using stablecoin operations to evade existing financial regulations.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Review and Update Schedule\n\nThis policy is a living document and shall be reviewed:\n*   **Bi-Annually:** A formal review every six months to assess its effectiveness and incorporate learnings from interim approvals.\n*   **Trigger-Based:** Immediately upon the enactment of any new Palestinian law or regulation directly pertaining to digital assets, virtual currencies, or payment systems.\n*   The policy version will be updated accordingly, and changes will be communicated to all engaged Applicants and stakeholders.\n\n---\n\n## 7. References to Regulatory Requirements\n\nThis policy is developed with reference to and in anticipation of alignment with the following frameworks (non-exhaustive):\n\n*   **Palestinian Law:** Palestinian Monetary Authority Law, Banking Law, Anti-Money Laundering Law No. (20) of 2015.\n*   **International Standards:** Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Recommendations, particularly those regarding Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs).\n*   **Comparative Models:** Principles from the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) Regulation, the UK’s Financial Services and Markets Act 2023, and guidance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Bank for International Settlements (BIS) on stablecoins.\n\n---\n*Document End*\n```"

Policy Statement\n[Company Name] is committed to full compliance with all applicable AML/CTF laws and regulations. We expressly prohibit the use of our services for any activity related to money laundering, terrorist financing, or other illicit conduct. This policy mandates a risk-based approach (RBA) to managing ML/TF risks associated with digital assets, requiring the implementation of systems and controls proportionate to the nature, size, and risks of our business.\n\n## 5. Procedures\n### 5.1 Risk-Based Approach (RBA)\nThe Company will conduct an annual Enterprise-Wide Risk Assessment (EWRA) to identify, assess, and understand the ML/TF risks to which it is exposed. This assessment will consider customer, product, service, transaction, geographic, and delivery channel risks. Controls will be calibrated to mitigate identified higher risks.\n\n### 5.2 Customer Identification Program (CIP) & Know Your Customer (KYC)\n1. **Customer Onboarding:** Identity verification is required for all customers prior to establishing a business relationship or conducting an occasional transaction above the designated threshold [$X or equivalent in digital assets].\n2. **Minimum Identification Data:** For natural persons: legal name, date of birth, residential address, and a government-issued identification number.

The Company will implement an automated **Transaction Monitoring System** calibrated to detect patterns of activity indicative of ML/TF.\n2. Red flags include, but are not limited to: rapid layering of assets, structuring transactions to avoid reporting thresholds, transactions with no logical economic purpose, or transactions involving sanctioned addresses/entities.\n3. All monitored transactions will be reviewed by the Compliance Officer or designee. Alerts and findings will be documented.\n\n### 5.5 Suspicious Activity Reporting\n1. Where a transaction or activity gives rise to a suspicion or reasonable grounds for suspicion of ML/TF, an internal **Suspicious Activity Report (SAR)** will be filed with the Compliance Officer immediately.\n2. The Compliance Officer will assess the internal SAR and, if warranted, file an external SAR with the relevant national **Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU)** within the mandated timeframe, without tipping off the customer.\n3. A record of all internal and external SARs will be maintained.\n\n### 5.6 Record Keeping\nAll records obtained during CIP, KYC, EDD, and transaction monitoring (including customer identification data, account files, and business correspondence) will be maintained for a minimum period of **five (5) years** after the business relationship ends or the transaction is completed, in accordance with applicable law.\n\n## 6.

Review and Update Schedule\nThis policy shall be reviewed and updated:\n- **Annually,** as part of the EWRA process.\n- **Immediately,** following any material changes in regulatory requirements, the Company's business model, or in response to significant ML/TF incidents.\n- All revisions require approval by the Company's Board of Directors or designated senior management committee.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements\nThis policy is designed to comply with, but is not limited to, the following standards and regulations:\n- The **FATF Recommendations** (especially Recommendation 15 and its Interpretive Note on Virtual Assets).\n- The **FATF Guidance on Virtual Assets and VASPs** (2019, updated 2021).\n- [Insert specific national legislation, e.g., **Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)** in the US, **5AMLD/6AMLD** in the EU, or equivalent local AML/CTF statutes].\n- Regulations enforced by [Insert name of local financial regulator, e.g., **FinCEN, FINMA, FCA**].\n\n---\n**Policy Version:** 1.0  \n**Effective Date:** [Date]  \n**Approved By:** [Name/Title of Approver]\n```"
