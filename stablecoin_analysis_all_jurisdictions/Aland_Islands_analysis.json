This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Aland Islands\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-02-12T17:24:04.177276\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company currently has no documented policies addressing stablecoin regulatory requirements for Aland Islands operations. This represents a critical compliance gap that prevents lawful operation in this jurisdiction. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive regulatory compliance program before commencing any stablecoin-related activities. The highest priority gaps relate to licensing, reserve backing, and AML/CFT compliance, which are fundamental regulatory requirements in most jurisdictions including Aland Islands (which likely follows EU/financial regulatory standards).\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance requires licensing/authorization from relevant financial authority\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy for stablecoin issuance authorization\n\n**Gap:** Company lacks policies and procedures for obtaining necessary regulatory approvals for stablecoin operations in Aland Islands\n\n**Impact:** Potential for regulatory enforcement actions, fines, and prohibition of operations\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop a regulatory licensing framework that includes: 1) Jurisdictional analysis for Aland Islands, 2) Application procedures for financial licenses, 3) Ongoing compliance monitoring for license maintenance\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin reserves must be fully backed and subject to regular audits\n\n**Current Status:** No reserve management or audit policies documented\n\n**Gap:** Missing policies for reserve composition, custody, verification, and independent auditing\n\n**Impact:** Risk of insolvency, loss of customer funds, and regulatory sanctions for misrepresentation\n\n**Recommendation:** Create comprehensive reserve management policy including: 1) 100% backing requirement, 2) Qualified custodian requirements, 3) Monthly attestations, 4) Quarterly independent audits, 5) Public disclosure protocols\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance including customer due diligence and transaction monitoring\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop stablecoin-specific AML/CFT program including: 1) Risk assessment for Aland Islands, 2) Enhanced due diligence for large transactions, 3) Travel rule compliance, 4) Suspicious activity reporting procedures\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including disclosures and redemption rights\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement consumer protection policy covering: 1) Clear terms of service, 2) Redemption procedures and timelines, 3) Fee transparency, 4) Complaint handling process, 5) Risk disclosures\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Cybersecurity and operational resilience requirements\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish stablecoin cybersecurity framework including: 1) Multi-signature wallet controls, 2) Cold storage protocols, 3) Incident response plan, 4) Regular penetration testing, 5) Business continuity planning\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **licensing_authorization**: not_met\n❌
