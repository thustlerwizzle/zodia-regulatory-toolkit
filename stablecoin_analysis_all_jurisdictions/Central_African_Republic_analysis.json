Purpose and Scope\n### 2.1 Purpose\nThis policy establishes a comprehensive framework for the management, custody, and verification of reserves backing issued stablecoins. Its primary objectives are to:\n- Ensure reserves are sufficient to meet all redemption obligations at all times\n- Maintain reserve assets in secure, segregated custody arrangements\n- Provide transparency through regular independent audits\n- Comply with applicable regulatory requirements for stablecoin issuers\n- Mitigate operational, credit, liquidity, and market risks associated with reserve management\n\n### 2.2 Scope\nThis policy applies to:\n- All stablecoin issuance activities of the organization\n- All personnel involved in treasury management, finance, risk, and compliance functions\n- All third-party custodians and service providers engaged in reserve management\n- All reserve assets held to back outstanding stablecoin liabilities\n\n## 3. Definitions\n- **Stablecoin:** A digital asset designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified reference asset, typically a fiat currency.\n- **Reserve Assets:** The assets held by the issuer to fully back the outstanding stablecoins.\n- **Cover Ratio:** The ratio of the market value of reserve assets to the face value of outstanding stablecoins.\n- **High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA):** Assets that can be easily and immediately converted to cash at little or no loss of value.\n- **Segregated Custody:** Reserve assets held in accounts separate from the issuer's operating accounts, for the sole benefit of stablecoin holders.\n- **Independent Auditor:** A qualified third-party firm with relevant expertise engaged to verify reserve adequacy and composition.\n\n## 4.

The Treasury Department shall calculate the daily cover ratio by 9:00 AM each business day, comparing the mark-to-market value of all reserve assets to the total outstanding stablecoin supply.\n2. A \"Reserve Dashboard\" shall be maintained with real-time data on reserve composition, valuations, and the cover ratio.\n3. If the cover ratio falls below 100.5%, a pre-defined contingency plan (including potential suspension of new issuance) is triggered immediately, and the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Risk Officer are notified.\n\n### 5.4 Independent Third-Party Audits\n1. **Monthly Attestations:** An independent auditor shall perform a monthly examination, resulting in an attestation report confirming:\n   - The existence and ownership of reserve assets.\n   - The adequacy of reserves (cover ratio ≥ 100%) as of the examination date.\n   - The composition of reserves against the rules defined in Section 5.1.\n2. **Full Annual Audit:** An annual, more comprehensive audit shall be performed, including testing of internal controls over reserve management and custody arrangements.\n3.

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Central African Republic\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-01-30T20:23:04.560267\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company exhibits a complete lack of policies addressing stablecoin regulation in the Central African Republic. All identified regulatory requirements are currently not met, representing critical compliance gaps. The absence of any documented policies creates significant legal, operational, and reputational risks. Immediate action is required to conduct proper regulatory research and develop comprehensive policies before considering operations in the CAR jurisdiction. The highest priority should be given to establishing the legal framework, licensing compliance, and AML/CFT requirements, as these represent the most immediate regulatory risks.\n\n## Critical

policies for obtaining and maintaining required licenses in CAR\n\n**Impact:** Operating without required licenses could result in fines, business suspension, or criminal liability\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish licensing compliance procedures including application processes, renewal schedules, and regulatory reporting requirements\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance for stablecoin transactions in CAR\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop CAR-specific AML/CFT policies aligned with local regulations and FATF recommendations\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements\n\n**Recommendation:** Create comprehensive consumer protection framework including clear disclosures, terms of service, and complaint handling procedures\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Reserve management and auditing requirements for stablecoin issuers\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish reserve management policies including asset composition rules, custody arrangements, and regular third-party audits\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **legal_framework_requirements**: not_met\n❌ **licensing_requirements**: not_met\n❌ **aml_cft_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **consumer_protection**: not_met\n❌ **reserve_management**: not_met\n❌ **data_privacy**: not_met\n❌
