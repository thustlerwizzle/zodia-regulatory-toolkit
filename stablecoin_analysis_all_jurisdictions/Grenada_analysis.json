Purpose and Scope\n### Purpose\nThis policy establishes the framework for maintaining a 1:1 reserve of high-quality liquid assets to fully back all issued stablecoins, ensuring stability, redeemability, and regulatory compliance with the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) Digital Currency Framework and other applicable regulations.\n\n### Scope\nThis policy applies to all issued stablecoin liabilities of [Organization Name] (\"the Issuer\").

Independent Auditing\n*   The reserve must be subject to a **monthly attestation** by an Independent Auditor.\n*   The auditor will verify the existence, ownership, valuation, and 1:1 coverage of the reserve assets.\n*   A **full annual audit** must be conducted, the results of which will be published in a publicly available report.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n\n### 6.1. Reporting\n*   **Public Reporting:** A detailed Reserve Report, confirming the 1:1 backing and listing the composition of HQLA, must be published on the Issuer's website **monthly**, within 10 business days of month-end.\n*   **Regulatory Reporting:** All reports submitted to the ECCB, as required by the Digital Currency Framework, shall be filed accurately and in a timely manner.\n*   **Incident Reporting:** Any shortfall in the reserve, custodian failure, or breach of this policy must be reported to the Chief Compliance Officer and the ECCB immediately.\n\n### 6.2.

It will be updated as necessary to reflect changes in the ECCB Digital Currency Framework, other regulations, or operational best practices. All updates require formal approval by the Board of Directors.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements\nThis policy is designed to ensure compliance with, but is not limited to, the following regulatory cornerstone:\n*   **Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) Digital Currency Framework:** Specifically, the requirement for \"stablecoin issuers [to] maintain 1:1 reserves in high-quality liquid assets.\"\n*   All other applicable laws and regulations of the ECCU pertaining to digital assets, securities, and financial services.\n\n---\n**Policy Version:** 1.0  \n**Effective Date:** [Date]  \n**Approved By:** [Name, Title of Approver]\n```"

Valuation and Management\n*   The reserve portfolio must be valued **daily** at prevailing market prices (mark-to-market).\n*   The total value of the reserve must equal or exceed the total face value of stablecoins in circulation at the close of each business day.\n*   A **Reserve Manager**, segregated from issuance operations, is responsible for managing the portfolio to ensure liquidity and safety, adhering to a strict investment mandate derived from this policy.\n\n### 5.4. Independent Auditing\n*   The reserve must be subject to a **monthly attestation** by an Independent Auditor.\n*   The auditor will verify the existence, ownership, valuation, and 1:1 coverage of the reserve assets.\n*   A **full annual audit** must be conducted, the results of which will be published in a publicly available report.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n\n### 6.1. Reporting\n*   **Public Reporting:** A detailed Reserve Report, confirming the 1:1 backing and listing the composition of HQLA, must be published on the Issuer's website **monthly**, within 10 business days of month-end.\n*   **Regulatory Reporting:** All reports submitted to the ECCB, as required by the Digital Currency Framework, shall be filed accurately and in a timely manner.\n*   **Incident Reporting:** Any shortfall in the reserve, custodian failure, or breach of this policy must be reported to the Chief Compliance Officer and the ECCB immediately.\n\n### 6.2.

Review and Update Schedule\nThis policy shall be reviewed **annually** by the Compliance Department and the Board Risk Committee. It will be updated as necessary to reflect changes in the ECCB Digital Currency Framework, other regulations, or operational best practices. All updates require formal approval by the Board of Directors.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements\nThis policy is designed to ensure compliance with, but is not limited to, the following regulatory cornerstone:\n*   **Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) Digital Currency Framework:** Specifically, the requirement for \"stablecoin issuers [to] maintain 1:1 reserves in high-quality liquid assets.\"\n*   All other applicable laws and regulations of the ECCU pertaining to digital assets, securities, and financial services.\n\n---\n**Policy Version:** 1.0  \n**Effective Date:** [Date]  \n**Approved By:** [Name, Title of Approver]\n```"

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Grenada\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-01-30T23:41:02.304817\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company currently has no documented policies addressing Grenada's stablecoin regulatory requirements, representing a critical compliance gap. All essential regulatory areas—licensing, reserve management, AML/CFT, consumer protection, operational resilience, and reporting—are completely unaddressed. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive regulatory compliance framework to avoid significant legal, financial, and reputational risks. The company should prioritize establishing licensing and reserve management policies first, followed by AML/CFT and consumer protection frameworks.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance requires licensing/registration with Grenada's Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) or Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA)\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy for stablecoin issuance or regulatory registration\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing licensing requirements for stablecoin operations in Grenada\n\n**Impact:** Potential for regulatory enforcement actions, fines, or prohibition of operations in Grenada\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop a regulatory licensing framework policy that outlines requirements for ECCB/FSRA registration, application procedures, and ongoing compliance obligations\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must maintain 1:1 reserves in high-quality liquid assets as per ECCB Digital Currency Framework\n\n**Current Status:** No reserve management or asset backing policies documented\n\n**Gap:** Missing policies governing reserve composition, custody, auditing, and transparency requirements\n\n**Impact:** Risk of insolvency, loss of customer funds, and regulatory sanctions for reserve deficiencies\n\n**Recommendation:** Create a comprehensive reserve management policy specifying eligible assets, custody arrangements, independent auditing, and regular reporting\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance under Grenada's Proceeds of Crime Act and Financial Intelligence Unit requirements\n\n**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT policies for stablecoin operations\n\n**Gap:** Lack of customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting procedures\n\n**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties, loss of banking relationships, and reputational damage\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement a stablecoin-specific AML/CFT program including KYC procedures, transaction monitoring, and SAR filing protocols\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection requirements including disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop consumer protection policies covering product disclosures, redemption procedures, and formal complaint handling processes\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity standards for digital currency operations\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish operational resilience policies including cybersecurity standards, business continuity planning, and incident response protocols\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **licensing_registration**: not_met\n❌ **reserve_requirements**: not_met\n❌ **aml_cft_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **consumer_protection**: not_met\n❌ **operational_resilience**: not_met\n❌ **reporting_obligations**:
