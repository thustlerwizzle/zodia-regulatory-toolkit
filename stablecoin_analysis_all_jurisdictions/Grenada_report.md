# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T23:41:02.304817

## Executive Summary
The company currently has no documented policies addressing Grenada's stablecoin regulatory requirements, representing a critical compliance gap. All essential regulatory areas—licensing, reserve management, AML/CFT, consumer protection, operational resilience, and reporting—are completely unaddressed. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive regulatory compliance framework to avoid significant legal, financial, and reputational risks. The company should prioritize establishing licensing and reserve management policies first, followed by AML/CFT and consumer protection frameworks.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance requires licensing/registration with Grenada's Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) or Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA)

**Current Status:** No documented policy for stablecoin issuance or regulatory registration

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing licensing requirements for stablecoin operations in Grenada

**Impact:** Potential for regulatory enforcement actions, fines, or prohibition of operations in Grenada

**Recommendation:** Develop a regulatory licensing framework policy that outlines requirements for ECCB/FSRA registration, application procedures, and ongoing compliance obligations

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must maintain 1:1 reserves in high-quality liquid assets as per ECCB Digital Currency Framework

**Current Status:** No reserve management or asset backing policies documented

**Gap:** Missing policies governing reserve composition, custody, auditing, and transparency requirements

**Impact:** Risk of insolvency, loss of customer funds, and regulatory sanctions for reserve deficiencies

**Recommendation:** Create a comprehensive reserve management policy specifying eligible assets, custody arrangements, independent auditing, and regular reporting

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance under Grenada's Proceeds of Crime Act and Financial Intelligence Unit requirements

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT policies for stablecoin operations

**Gap:** Lack of customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting procedures

**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties, loss of banking relationships, and reputational damage

**Recommendation:** Implement a stablecoin-specific AML/CFT program including KYC procedures, transaction monitoring, and SAR filing protocols

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection requirements including disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling

**Recommendation:** Develop consumer protection policies covering product disclosures, redemption procedures, and formal complaint handling processes

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity standards for digital currency operations

**Recommendation:** Establish operational resilience policies including cybersecurity standards, business continuity planning, and incident response protocols
