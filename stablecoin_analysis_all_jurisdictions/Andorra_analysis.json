Public announcement of the suspension through official government and AFA channels.  \n   c. Establishment of a temporary reporting mechanism for entities to disclose pre-existing activities.\n\n**Phase 2: Licensing Strategy Development (Within 90 Days)**  \n   a. Formation of a cross-functional task force (including legal, financial, and technology experts).  \n   b. Formal engagement with the AFA to:  \n      - Identify specific regulatory requirements and risk categories.  \n      - Determine capital, reserve, governance, and consumer protection standards.  \n      - Draft licensing application forms and evaluation criteria.  \n   c. Development of a comprehensive licensing framework document for AFA approval.\n\n**Phase 3: Implementation and Transition**  \n   a. Public consultation on the draft licensing framework.  \n   b. Finalization and publication of the licensing regime.  \n   c. Opening of license applications with clear guidance for entities seeking authorization.\n\n## 6.

Review and Update Schedule  \nThis policy shall be reviewed and updated:  \n- **Interim Review:** 60 days after effective date to assess suspension impact.  \n- **Full Review:** Within 12 months, or immediately following the enactment of formal stablecoin legislation or AFA regulations.  \n- **Triggered Updates:** As required by changes in Andorran law, EU regulatory developments (given Andorra’s monetary agreement with the EU), or international standards.\n\n## 8.

Purpose and Scope\n\n### 2.1 Purpose\nThe purpose of this policy is to establish a robust framework for capital and reserve management to ensure:\n* All issued stablecoins are fully backed by high-quality reserve assets at all times.\n* The issuer maintains regulatory capital above required thresholds to ensure operational resilience, absorb potential losses, and protect stablecoin holders.\n* Compliance with all applicable local and international regulations governing stablecoin issuance and digital asset activities.\n\n### 2.2 Scope\nThis policy applies to:\n* All activities related to the issuance, redemption, and management of [Issuer Name] stablecoins (hereafter \"the Stablecoin\").\n* The Treasury Department, Finance Department, Risk Management, and Compliance teams.\n* All reserve assets held for the purpose of backing the Stablecoin.\n* All decisions regarding capital structure, reserve composition, and liquidity management.\n\n## 3. Definitions\n\n* **Stablecoin:** A digital asset issued by [Issuer Name] designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified fiat currency (e.g., USD, EUR).\n* **Reserve Assets:** The pool of assets held securely to fully back the outstanding supply of Stablecoins.\n* **Full Backing:** A reserve ratio of 100% or greater, where the market value of Reserve Assets equals or exceeds the aggregate face value of all outstanding Stablecoins.\n* **Regulatory Capital:** The permanent capital required by regulators to ensure the issuer's solvency and operational continuity, separate from reserve assets.\n* **High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA):** Assets that can be easily and immediately converted to cash at little to no loss of value, as defined by relevant regulations (e.g., cash, short-term government securities).\n* **Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR):** The ratio of an issuer's regulatory capital to its risk-weighted assets and exposures.\n* **Custodian:** A regulated financial institution responsible for the safekeeping of Reserve Assets.\n\n## 4.

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Andorra\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-01-30T05:20:33.430280\n\n## Executive Summary\nOverall compliance status is NON-COMPLIANT. The company currently has no documented policies addressing the core regulatory requirements for operating a stablecoin service in Andorra. This represents an extreme level of regulatory risk. Operating in this state would be unlawful. Immediate and foundational work is required to: 1) Understand the precise regulatory landscape through expert legal counsel, 2) Develop a complete suite of policies and controls before commencing any regulated activity, and 3) Engage proactively with the Andorran Financial Authority (AFA) to seek necessary authorization. All identified gaps are at least Medium priority, with several being Critical due to the legal prohibition of unlicensed financial services.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Legal authorization and licensing for stablecoin issuance and operation in Andorra\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy exists\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing Andorran regulatory requirements for stablecoin operations. Andorra requires specific authorization from the Andorran Financial Authority (AFA) for financial activities, including digital asset services.\n\n**Impact:** Legal prohibition of operations, regulatory enforcement actions, fines, and potential criminal liability for operating without proper authorization.\n\n**Recommendation:** Immediately suspend any stablecoin operations in Andorra until proper licensing is obtained. Develop a comprehensive licensing strategy and engage with the AFA to understand specific requirements.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance under Andorran Law 14/2017 and AFA regulations\n\n**Current Status:** No documented AML/CTF policy for Andorran operations\n\n**Gap:** No policies address Andorra's specific AML/CTF requirements, including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, reporting obligations to the UIFAND (Financial Intelligence Unit), and record-keeping mandates.\n\n**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, loss of license, reputational damage, and potential criminal prosecution for AML/CTF violations.\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop and implement an Andorra-specific AML/CTF program that aligns with Law 14/2017. Appoint a local compliance officer, establish customer identification procedures, and implement transaction monitoring systems.\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Capital and reserve requirements for stablecoin issuers\n\n**Recommendation:** Conduct research to determine exact capital and reserve requirements. Develop a treasury management policy that ensures full backing of issued stablecoins and meets regulatory capital thresholds.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection, disclosure, and transparency obligations\n\n**Recommendation:** Draft comprehensive terms of service, risk disclosures, and a transparency framework. Commit to publishing regular attestation reports or proof of reserves from a qualified third-party auditor.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity standards\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement a robust IT governance framework based on standards like ISO 27001. Develop incident response and business continuity plans specific to stablecoin operations.\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **licensing_and_authorization**: not_met\n❌ **aml_ctf_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **capital_reserve_requirements**: not_met\n❌ **consumer_protection**: not_met\n❌ **operational_risk_cybersecurity**: not_met\n❌ **governance**: not_met\n❌ **tax_compliance**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update Summary\nGenerated: 2026-01-30T05:21:24.424092\n\n## Overview\nThis document summarizes proposed updates to company policies and standards based on regulatory gap analysis.\n\n## New Policies Required\n\n## Modified Policies\n\n### GAP-001\n**Category:** Legal\n**Current Policy:** No documented policy exists\n**Proposed Change:** Immediately suspend any stablecoin operations in Andorra until proper licensing is obtained. Develop a comprehensive licensing strategy and engage with the AFA to understand specific requirements.\n\n### GAP-002\n**Category:** AML/KYC\n**Current Policy:** No documented AML/CTF policy for Andorran operations\n**Proposed Change:** Develop and implement an Andorra-specific AML/CTF program that aligns with Law 14/2017.
