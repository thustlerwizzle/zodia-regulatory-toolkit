Purpose and Scope\n### 2.1 Purpose\nThis policy establishes a comprehensive framework for the management, custody, and verification of reserves backing issued stablecoins. The primary objectives are to:\n- Ensure 1:1 backing of all issued stablecoins with high-quality liquid assets\n- Maintain operational resilience and liquidity under stress conditions\n- Provide transparency to regulators, users, and the public\n- Comply with international regulatory standards and emerging jurisdictional requirements\n\n### 2.2 Scope\nThis policy applies to:\n- All stablecoin issuance activities of [Organization Name]\n- All departments involved in treasury management, compliance, risk, and financial reporting\n- Third-party custodians and service providers managing reserve assets\n- All reserve assets held against outstanding stablecoin liabilities\n\n## 3. Definitions\n- **Stablecoin:** A digital asset issued by [Organization Name] designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified reference asset (e.g., USD).\n- **Reserve Assets:** The portfolio of high-quality liquid assets held to fully back the value of outstanding stablecoins.\n- **High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA):** Assets that are low risk, easily and immediately convertible into cash with minimal loss of value, as defined by international standards.\n- **1:1 Reserve Ratio:** The requirement that the total value of reserve assets equals or exceeds the total face value of outstanding stablecoins at all times.\n- **Independent Attestor:** A qualified third-party firm (accounting or specialized attestation firm) with relevant expertise to perform reserve examinations.\n- **Segregated Custody:** The holding of reserve assets in accounts legally separated from the operational assets of [Organization Name], protected from insolvency or creditor claims.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\n[Organization Name] is committed to maintaining full backing for all issued stablecoins with a reserve consisting exclusively of High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA). Reserves will be held at a 1:1 ratio or greater, managed with utmost safety and liquidity, and subject to independent verification and public disclosure. The reserve portfolio shall be insulated from operational risks through segregated custody arrangements.\n\n## 5. Procedures\n\n### 5.1 Eligible Reserve Asset Types\nThe reserve portfolio shall consist only of the following asset classes, consistent with BIS/FSB recommendations for HQLA:\n- **Cash and Cash Equivalents:**\n    - Demand deposits and overnight funds held at regulated banking institutions with a minimum credit rating of [e.g., A- from S&P or equivalent].\n    - Central bank reserves, where accessible.\n- **Short-Term Government Securities:**\n    - Direct obligations of sovereign governments with a minimum credit rating of [e.g., AA- from S&P or equivalent].\n    - Maximum remaining maturity of 3 months (for Level 1 HQLA) or 12 months (for permissible Level 2A HQLA, subject to concentration limits).\n    - Must be highly liquid and traded in deep, active markets.\n- **Explicitly Prohibited Assets:** Corporate debt, commercial paper, equities, cryptocurrencies, loans, derivatives, or any asset not explicitly listed above.\n\n### 5.2 Segregated Custody Arrangements\n- All reserve assets must be held with qualified, regulated custodians (e.g., banks, trust companies, regulated digital asset custodians).\n- Custody agreements must legally establish the assets as the property of the reserve, held for the benefit of stablecoin holders, and segregated from the custodian's and [Organization Name]'s operating assets.\n- The Treasury Department must conduct initial and annual due diligence on all custodians.\n- Access to move or pledge reserve assets requires dual authorization by designated senior officials.\n\n### 5.3 Reserve Management & Operational Workflow\n1. **Issuance/Redemption Link:** The Treasury Department must receive real-time notification of stablecoin issuances and redemptions from the Technology Department.\n2. **Daily Reconciliation:** By 9:00 AM each business day, Treasury must reconcile the total outstanding stablecoin liability with the total market value of reserve assets.\n3. **Rebalancing:** If the reserve ratio falls below 100.5% (allowing a small buffer), Treasury must initiate same-day transfer of eligible assets into the reserve to restore the minimum 101% target ratio.\n4. **Liquidity Stress Testing:** The Risk Department will perform monthly stress tests to ensure reserves can meet potential mass redemption scenarios.\n\n### 5.4 Independent Attestation\n- An independent third-party firm will be engaged to perform a monthly examination of the reserve.\n- The attestation report must confirm:\n    a) The reserve assets were equal to or greater than the outstanding stablecoin liabilities as of the month-end calculation date.\n    b) The reserve consisted solely of eligible HQLA.\n    c) The assets were held in segregated custody per the policy.\n- The final attestation report must be received by the 15th day of the following month.\n\n### 5.5 Public Disclosure\n- A monthly Reserve Report will be published on [Organization Name]'s public website by the 20th day of each month for the prior month-end position.\n- The report will include:\n    - Total value of outstanding stablecoins.\n    - Total value of reserve assets.\n    - Reserve Ratio.\n    - Detailed composition of reserves (by asset type, issuer, maturity profile).\n    - Name of the independent attestor and a link to the attestation report summary.\n    - Aggregate custodian names.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n- The Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) is responsible for overseeing adherence to this policy.\n- The Treasury Department is responsible for day-to-day implementation and daily reconciliation.\n- Failure to maintain the 1:1 ratio is a Tier 1 incident, requiring immediate escalation to the CEO, Board, and regulators (as required).\n- Any deviation from the eligible asset list or custody requirements requires pre-approval by the Board Risk Committee.\n- All personnel involved must complete annual training on this policy.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule\nThis policy shall be reviewed:\n- **Annually** by the Compliance and Risk Departments to ensure alignment with regulatory developments and operational effectiveness.\n- **Ad-hoc** following any material change in relevant international standards (BIS/FSB), domestic regulation, or a control failure.\n- All changes require approval by the Chief Compliance Officer and the Board Risk Committee.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements\nThis policy is designed to align with and satisfy the principles and recommendations from:\n- **Financial Stability Board (FSB):** \"High-level Recommendations for the Regulation, Supervision and Oversight of Global Stablecoin Arrangements\" (2020).\n- **Bank for International Settlements (BIS) – Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS):** \"Basel III: International framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring\" (specifically the LCR and HQLA definitions).\n- **International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO):** \"Policy Recommendations for Crypto and Digital Asset Markets\" (relevant sections on stablecoins).\n- [*Note: Insert references to specific national/jurisdictional regulations as applicable.*]\n\n---\n**Policy Version:** 1.0  \n**Effective Date:** [Date]  \n**Approved By:** [Name of Board Risk Committee Chair]  \n**Owner:** Chief Compliance Officer, [Organization Name]\n```"

Based on international standards and emerging regulatory trends, all fundamental compliance areas are completely unaddressed. The company is operating in a pre-compliance state and would face immediate regulatory action if offering services. Urgent action is required across all compliance domains, with immediate priority on licensing engagement, reserve management, and AML/CFT frameworks. The company should not commence operations until these critical gaps are addressed.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must maintain 1:1 reserves in high-quality liquid assets (based on international standards like BIS/FSB recommendations)\n\n**Current Status:** No documented reserve management policy\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of reserve management framework, including asset composition, custody, and audit requirements\n\n**Impact:** Regulatory enforcement action, loss of license, reputational damage, potential consumer harm if reserves are insufficient\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop and implement a comprehensive reserve management policy specifying: 1) Eligible asset types (cash, government securities), 2) Segregated custody arrangements, 3) Monthly independent attestations, 4) Public disclosure of reserve composition\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance including customer due diligence,

full AML/CFT program including: 1) Risk-based customer identification and verification, 2) Ongoing transaction monitoring system, 3) Designated compliance officer, 4) Regular staff training, 5) SAR filing procedures\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Licensing/registration with relevant authorities (Bank of Guyana or proposed regulatory body)\n\n**Current Status:** No licensing strategy or application process documented\n\n**Gap:** No evidence of engagement with regulators or understanding of licensing requirements\n\n**Impact:** Operating illegally, immediate shutdown orders, fines, director liability\n\n**Recommendation:** Immediately initiate regulatory engagement to determine licensing requirements and submit necessary applications before offering services\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including clear disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling\n\n**Recommendation:** Create consumer protection framework with: 1) Clear terms of service and risk disclosures, 2) Guaranteed redemption procedures, 3) Dedicated complaint handling process, 4) Escrow mechanisms for disputed transactions\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity standards\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive cybersecurity program including: 1) Multi-sig wallet management, 2) Cold storage protocols, 3) Incident response plan, 4) Regular penetration testing, 5) Business continuity planning\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-006\n**Requirement:** Regular reporting to regulators (financial, operational, compliance)\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop regulatory reporting calendar and templates for: 1) Monthly reserve attestations, 2) Quarterly financial statements, 3) Annual compliance reports, 4) Incident reporting protocols\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **reserve_requirements**: not_met\n❌ **aml_cft_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **consumer_protection**: not_met\n❌
