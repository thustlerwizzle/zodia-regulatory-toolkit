# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T05:47:26.115063

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits a complete lack of policies addressing Armenian stablecoin regulations. All regulatory requirements are currently unmet, creating critical compliance risks. Immediate action is required to develop foundational policies, particularly regarding legal classification and licensing. The company should prioritize engaging Armenian legal counsel and regulatory experts to understand the specific requirements before developing comprehensive compliance policies. Given Armenia's evolving regulatory landscape for digital assets, the company should also establish ongoing regulatory monitoring procedures to track new developments.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Legal definition and classification of stablecoins under Armenian law

**Current Status:** No policy exists

**Gap:** Company lacks policies defining stablecoins and their regulatory treatment in Armenia. No classification framework exists for determining if stablecoins are considered e-money, payment tokens, or other financial instruments.

**Impact:** Operating without clear legal classification exposes company to regulatory enforcement, license revocation, fines, and potential criminal liability for unauthorized financial activities.

**Recommendation:** Engage Armenian legal counsel to research and document the current regulatory classification of stablecoins. Develop internal classification policy based on Central Bank of Armenia and Ministry of Finance guidance.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Licensing requirements for stablecoin issuance or service provision

**Current Status:** No licensing policy or procedures

**Gap:** No policies address licensing requirements for stablecoin operations in Armenia. No procedures for obtaining or maintaining required licenses from Armenian regulatory authorities.

**Impact:** Operating without required licenses could result in immediate shutdown, substantial fines, and potential criminal charges for unauthorized financial services.

**Recommendation:** Conduct regulatory mapping to identify required licenses (payment institution, e-money institution, etc.). Develop licensing compliance policy with application procedures and ongoing maintenance requirements.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Reserve requirements and asset backing for stablecoins

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive reserve management policy including: 1) Acceptable asset types, 2) Custody arrangements, 3) Regular auditing requirements, 4) Public disclosure procedures, 5) Liquidity management protocols.

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance for stablecoin transactions

**Recommendation:** Develop stablecoin-specific AML/CFT policy incorporating: 1) Risk-based customer verification, 2) Transaction monitoring thresholds, 3) Suspicious activity reporting procedures, 4) Compliance with Armenian FIU requirements.

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity

**Recommendation:** Develop operational risk framework covering: 1) Smart contract security audits, 2) Private key management procedures, 3) Cybersecurity controls meeting Armenian standards, 4) Business continuity planning.
