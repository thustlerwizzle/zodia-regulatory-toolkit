# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T19:08:08.237670

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits a complete absence of policies addressing stablecoin operations in Bhutan, representing a critical compliance failure. All regulatory requirements are currently unmet due to the lack of any documented policies or procedures. The most urgent gaps relate to legal authorization, AML/CTF compliance, and consumer protection. Immediate action is required to: 1) Conduct comprehensive regulatory research on Bhutan's stablecoin regime, 2) Suspend all stablecoin-related activities until compliance is established, and 3) Develop a complete policy framework addressing all identified regulatory requirements. The company should engage local legal counsel in Bhutan to obtain accurate regulatory guidance before proceeding with any stablecoin operations.
