This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Gaza Strip\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-02-12T18:56:10.420141\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company exhibits critical compliance deficiencies with no established policies addressing stablecoin operations, particularly concerning high-risk jurisdictions like Gaza Strip. All regulatory requirements are currently unmet, creating severe legal, financial, and reputational risks. Immediate action is required to establish a comprehensive compliance framework, with highest priority given to sanctions compliance, AML/CTF, and geographic risk management. The absence of any documented policies suggests the company may be operating in violation of multiple regulatory regimes and international sanctions.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Compliance with international sanctions regimes (UN, OFAC, EU) prohibiting financial transactions with designated entities in Gaza Strip\n\n**Current Status:** No specific policy addressing Gaza Strip or stablecoin transactions in conflict zones\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing sanctions compliance for stablecoin operations involving Gaza Strip entities\n\n**Impact:** Severe legal and reputational risks including criminal penalties, regulatory enforcement actions, and loss of banking relationships\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive sanctions screening program with real-time OFAC/SDN list checks, geographic restrictions, and enhanced due diligence for Gaza-related transactions\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) requirements for virtual asset service providers (VASP)\n\n**Current Status:** No documented AML/CTF policy for stablecoin operations\n\n**Gap:** Missing AML/CTF framework specific to stablecoin transactions, including customer identification, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting\n\n**Impact:**
