Immediate action is required to: 1) Determine legal permissibility of operations, 2) Develop core policies for reserves, AML, and consumer protection before any further activity, and 3) Engage with Lebanese regulators (primarily Banque du Liban) to understand specific local requirements. The current state suggests the company may not be legally operational and is exposed to severe enforcement risks."

Purpose and Scope\n### 2.1 Purpose\nThis policy establishes the mandatory framework for obtaining legal authorization to issue, manage, or facilitate stablecoins within or from the jurisdiction of Lebanon. Its primary purpose is to ensure full compliance with Lebanese regulatory requirements, specifically those mandated by Banque du Liban (BDL), and to mitigate legal, financial, and reputational risks associated with unauthorized digital currency activities.\n\n### 2.2 Scope\nThis policy applies to all employees, contractors, subsidiaries, and affiliated entities of [Company Name] involved in or considering any activity related to the issuance, distribution, management, marketing, or technological development of stablecoins or similar digital assets pegged to a fiat currency or other value reference. This includes, but is not limited to, product development teams, legal, compliance, finance, and executive leadership.\n\n## 3. Definitions\n*   **Banque du Liban (BDL):** The central bank of the Republic of Lebanon, the primary regulatory authority for monetary operations, payment systems, and financial stability within Lebanon.\n*   **Stablecoin:** A type of digital asset designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified reference, such as a fiat currency (e.g., US Dollar, Lebanese Pound), a commodity, or a basket of assets.\n*   **Issuance:** The act of creating, generating, and releasing stablecoins into circulation.\n*   **Authorization:** The formal written license, approval, or permit granted by BDL or other relevant Lebanese authorities that legally permits an entity to conduct stablecoin issuance activities.\n*   **Authorization Framework:** The internal documented process outlining the steps, requirements, and responsibilities for seeking, obtaining, and maintaining regulatory authorization.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\n[Company Name] is committed to operating with the highest standards of legal and regulatory integrity. Until explicit written authorization is obtained from the Banque du Liban (BDL), all activities related to the issuance of stablecoins are strictly prohibited. The company will proactively engage with Lebanese regulatory bodies and legal experts to understand and fulfill all necessary requirements before initiating any related project or commercial activity.\n\n## 5. Procedures\n### 5.1 Immediate Suspension of Activities\n1.  All current projects, development work, or planning related to the issuance of a stablecoin are hereby suspended effective immediately upon the adoption of this policy.\n2.  Project leads must formally document the status of all suspended work and secure any related assets or intellectual property.\n\n### 5.2 Regulatory Clarification Phase\n1.  The Legal Department shall, within 30 days of this policy's effective date, engage a qualified Lebanese legal counsel specializing in financial regulation and digital assets.\n2.  The primary mandate of this counsel will be to:\n    *   Provide a definitive legal opinion on the regulatory landscape for stablecoins in Lebanon.\n    *   Identify the specific laws, circulars, and regulations administered by BDL that govern digital asset issuance.\n    *   Clarify the precise application process, eligibility criteria, capital requirements, and ongoing obligations for an authorization.\n\n### 5.3 Development of Authorization Framework\n1.  Based on the findings from the legal counsel, the Compliance Department, in conjunction with the Legal Department, shall develop a comprehensive \"Stablecoin Authorization Framework\" document.\n2.  This Framework shall include, at a minimum:\n    *   A detailed roadmap for the authorization application process.\n    *   Defined roles and responsibilities (RACI matrix) for internal teams.\n    *   Technical, operational, and financial compliance requirements.\n    *   A risk management and consumer protection plan.\n    *   A plan for ongoing regulatory reporting and engagement.\n3.  The draft Framework must be reviewed and approved by the Executive Committee before any further steps are taken.\n\n### 5.4 Application and Launch\n1.  No stablecoin issuance activity may resume until:\n    a. The Authorization Framework is approved.\n    b. A formal application is submitted to BDL as per their guidelines.\n    c. Written authorization is received from BDL.\n2.  The launch of any authorized stablecoin product must follow a separate, approved go-live protocol that includes compliance checks.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n*   **Mandatory Adherence:** All personnel must comply with this policy. Violations constitute a serious breach of company rules and may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.\n*   **Reporting Obligation:** Any employee aware of potential or actual violations of this policy must report them immediately to their manager, the Legal Department, or via the company's confidential ethics hotline.\n*   **Record Keeping:** The Legal and Compliance Departments shall maintain complete records of all legal opinions, regulatory correspondence, application materials, and the final authorization grant.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule\nThis policy shall be reviewed annually by the Head of Compliance and the General Counsel. It must be updated promptly in response to:\n*   Changes in Lebanese law or BDL regulations.\n*   The receipt of regulatory authorization.\n*   Material changes in the company's business model related to digital assets.\nThe version history shall be maintained within the document.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements\nThis policy is formulated in direct response to the regulatory environment in Lebanon. While specific circulars will be identified during the legal clarification phase (Section 5.2), the policy anticipates compliance primarily with:\n*   The Code of Money and Credit, which grants BDL its regulatory authority.\n*   Relevant BDL Intermediate Circulars (expected to pertain to digital currencies, payment systems, and anti-money laundering).\n*   Lebanese Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing laws and regulations.\n*   Any future dedicated legislation or regulatory framework for virtual assets issued by the Lebanese government or BDL.\n\n---\n**Policy Effective Date:** [Date]\n**Policy Owner:** General Counsel / Chief Compliance Officer\n**Approved By:** [Name of CEO/Board Member]\n**Version:** 1.0\n```"

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Lebanon\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-02-05T23:54:19.740562\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company exhibits a complete lack of policies addressing fundamental regulatory requirements for stablecoin issuance and operation in Lebanon. Based on standard regulatory expectations for stablecoins globally and Lebanon's likely alignment with international standards, compliance status is 'not_met' across all critical domains. The company is operating with extreme regulatory risk. Immediate action is required to: 1) Determine legal permissibility of operations, 2) Develop core policies for reserves, AML, and consumer protection before any further activity, and 3) Engage with Lebanese regulators (primarily Banque du Liban) to understand specific local requirements. The current state suggests the company may not be legally operational and is exposed to severe enforcement risks.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Legal authorization to issue stablecoins in Lebanon (likely requiring approval from Banque du Liban - BDL)\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found regarding stablecoin issuance authorization\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policy addressing the fundamental regulatory requirement for authorization to operate as a stablecoin issuer in Lebanon\n\n**Impact:** Potential for immediate regulatory enforcement action, including cease-and-desist orders, fines, and criminal liability for operating without proper authorization\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Immediately suspend any stablecoin issuance activities until regulatory clarity is obtained. 2. Engage Lebanese legal counsel to determine specific authorization requirements from BDL. 3. Develop an Authorization Framework Policy outlining the process for obtaining and maintaining necessary licenses.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Reserve requirements and backing asset management (likely requiring full backing with high-quality liquid assets)\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy on reserve management, asset composition, or custody arrangements\n\n**Gap:** No policies governing the composition, custody, audit, or transparency of reserve assets backing stablecoins\n\n**Impact:** Risk of insolvency, loss of consumer funds, regulatory sanctions for misrepresentation, and loss of market confidence leading to potential stablecoin de-pegging\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Develop a Comprehensive Reserve Management Policy specifying: asset types permitted (e.g., cash, government securities), minimum liquidity ratios, custody requirements with qualified custodians, and independent audit frequency. 2. Implement real-time reserve reporting mechanisms. 3. Establish segregation of client funds from corporate assets.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance specific to virtual assets (likely aligned with FATF recommendations)\n\n**Current Status:** No documented AML/CTF policy specific to stablecoin operations\n\n**Gap:** Lack of risk-based AML/CTF program addressing stablecoin-specific risks including wallet screening, transaction monitoring for mixing/tumbling, and enhanced due diligence for high-risk jurisdictions\n\n**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties, potential designation as a money laundering concern, loss of banking relationships, and reputational damage\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Develop a Virtual Asset AML/CTF Policy incorporating: customer identification and verification (KYC) for all wallet holders, transaction monitoring systems, suspicious activity reporting procedures, and sanctions screening. 2. Appoint a dedicated Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO). 3. Implement blockchain analytics tools for transaction monitoring.\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including redemption rights, disclosures, and complaint handling\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Create a Consumer Protection Policy that guarantees timely redemption at par value. 2. Develop clear, plain-language disclosures covering all risks and fees. 3. Establish a formal complaints handling procedure with defined resolution timelines. 4. Implement a user education program on stablecoin risks.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity standards for digital asset platforms\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Develop a Digital Asset Cybersecurity Policy covering: secure key generation and storage (preferably using HSMs), smart contract audit requirements before deployment, penetration testing schedule, and incident response plan. 2. Implement multi-signature schemes for treasury transactions. 3. Establish a bug bounty program.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-006\n**Requirement:** Regular reporting and audit requirements to regulatory authorities\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Create a Regulatory Reporting Policy detailing report types, frequencies, responsible parties, and review procedures. 2. Establish a relationship with an audit firm experienced in digital assets. 3. Develop internal controls for data collection and report preparation.\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **legal_authorization**: not_met\n❌ **reserve_requirements**: not_met\n❌ **aml_ctf_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **consumer_protection**: not_met\n❌ **operational_resilience**: not_met\n❌ **reporting_audit**: not_met\n❌ **governance_framework**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update Summary\nGenerated: 2026-02-05T23:55:09.090884\n\n## Overview\nThis document summarizes proposed updates to company policies and standards based on regulatory gap analysis.\n\n## New Policies Required\n\n## Modified Policies\n\n### GAP-001\n**Category:** Legal\n**Current Policy:** No documented policy found regarding stablecoin issuance authorization\n**Proposed Change:** 1.
