## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no documented policies for stablecoin operations in Wallis and Futuna, representing a complete regulatory compliance failure. All core regulatory requirements for stablecoin issuance and operation are unmet. Immediate action is required to: 1) Suspend operations until regulatory landscape is properly assessed, 2) Conduct comprehensive regulatory research specific to Wallis and Futuna, 3) Develop a complete compliance framework before resuming any operations.
