# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T22:11:20.038260

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY - The company currently has no policies addressing El Salvador's cryptocurrency regulatory requirements. This represents a severe compliance risk, particularly regarding the mandatory acceptance of Bitcoin as legal tender. Immediate action is required to develop and implement comprehensive cryptocurrency policies. The most critical gap is the absence of Bitcoin acceptance procedures required by national law. Additionally, significant gaps exist in AML, cybersecurity, and consumer protection areas that could result in regulatory sanctions, financial losses, and reputational damage. The company should prioritize developing a foundational cryptocurrency compliance framework before engaging in any cryptocurrency-related activities in El Salvador.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Legal Tender Status for Bitcoin - Under El Salvador's Bitcoin Law (Ley Bitcoin), Bitcoin is recognized as legal tender alongside the US dollar. Businesses must accept Bitcoin as payment unless they lack the technological capability to do so.

**Current Status:** No policy exists regarding acceptance of Bitcoin as payment or handling of Bitcoin transactions.

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing Bitcoin acceptance, transaction processing, accounting, or customer communication regarding Bitcoin payments as required by Salvadoran law.

**Impact:** Legal non-compliance with national law, potential fines, inability to operate legally in El Salvador, reputational damage, and possible criminal liability for company officers.

**Recommendation:** Immediately develop and implement a Bitcoin Acceptance Policy that includes: 1) Procedures for accepting Bitcoin payments, 2) Integration with Chivo wallet or other approved systems, 3) Accounting treatment of Bitcoin transactions, 4) Customer communication protocols, 5) Employee training on Bitcoin transactions.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Stablecoin Regulation - While El Salvador has embraced Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies including stablecoins operate in a regulatory gray area. The Central Reserve Bank of El Salvador has indicated that entities issuing or operating with stablecoins may require authorization.

**Recommendation:** Develop a Cryptocurrency Risk Assessment Policy that: 1) Requires regulatory analysis before engaging with any cryptocurrency beyond Bitcoin, 2) Establishes due diligence procedures for stablecoin providers, 3) Creates approval workflows for stablecoin-related activities, 4) Implements monitoring for regulatory developments.

### Gap 2: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) for Crypto Transactions - El Salvador requires Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) to comply with AML regulations. While the Bitcoin Law exempts some Bitcoin transactions, businesses must still monitor for suspicious activities.

**Recommendation:** Create a Cryptocurrency AML/CFT Policy that includes: 1) Enhanced due diligence for large or suspicious crypto transactions, 2) Transaction monitoring specific to cryptocurrency patterns, 3) Reporting procedures for suspicious crypto activities, 4) Employee training on crypto-related financial crime risks.

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Cybersecurity for Digital Assets - While not explicitly detailed in the Bitcoin Law, businesses handling cryptocurrency have heightened cybersecurity obligations to protect customer funds and data.

**Recommendation:** Establish a Cryptocurrency Security Policy that includes: 1) Secure private key management procedures, 2) Multi-signature requirements for large transactions, 3) Cold storage protocols for significant holdings, 4) Regular security audits of crypto systems, 5) Incident response plans for crypto breaches.
