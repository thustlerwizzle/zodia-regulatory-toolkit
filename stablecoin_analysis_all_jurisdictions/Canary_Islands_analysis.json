Purpose and Scope\n### 2.1 Purpose\nThis policy establishes a comprehensive framework to ensure that all issued stablecoins are fully backed by High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) at a 1:1 ratio. Its primary objectives are to ensure regulatory compliance, maintain financial stability, protect token holders, and foster transparency and trust.\n\n### 2.2 Scope\nThis policy applies to all stablecoin issuance activities conducted by [Company Name] within the Canary Islands, as an EU territory. It is binding on all employees, contractors, and third-party service providers involved in the issuance, reserve management, custody, reporting, or related control functions.\n\n## 3. Definitions\n*   **Stablecoin:** A type of crypto-asset that purports to maintain a stable value by referencing to the value of an official currency.\n*   **HQLA (High-Quality Liquid Assets):** Assets that qualify as Level 1 assets as defined under the EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) and are consistent with Basel III standards. This includes cash, central bank reserves, and high-quality sovereign debt securities.\n*   **Reserves:** The aggregate pool of HQLA held to back the total outstanding stablecoins in circulation.\n*   **Issuer:** [Company Name], the entity legally responsible for issuing the stablecoin and maintaining the reserve.\n*   **Independent Custodian:** A regulated financial institution, separate from the Issuer, responsible for the safekeeping of the reserve assets.\n*   **Attestation:** A formal verification report issued by an independent qualified auditor or audit firm.\n*   **MiCA:** Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 of the European Parliament and of the Council on Markets in Crypto-assets.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\n[Company Name] is committed to operating with the highest standards of integrity and compliance. It is our unequivocal policy to maintain at all times a 1:1 reserve of HQLA for every unit of stablecoin issued. Reserves will be held securely, managed prudently, and their composition and value will be subject to independent verification and transparent public reporting.\n\n## 5. Procedures\n### 5.1 Reserve Composition & 1:1 Backing Requirement\n*   The total market value of the reserve must equal or exceed the total nominal value of all stablecoins in circulation at the close of each business day.\n*   The reserve must be comprised exclusively of HQLA as defined in Section 3. The Treasury Department is responsible for ensuring the reserve portfolio adheres to the defined asset quality criteria.\n*   No fractional reserve practices are permitted. The reserve must be segregated from the company's operational funds and cannot be leveraged, lent, or used as collateral for other activities.\n\n### 5.2 Daily Reserve Calculation & Reconciliation\n*   The Finance Department will calculate the total stablecoins in circulation daily based on minting and redemption data.\n*   The Treasury Department will value the reserve portfolio daily using mark-to-market principles based on reliable pricing sources.\n*   A daily reconciliation report will be generated, confirming the 1:1 coverage. Any shortfall must be remedied immediately by adding qualifying HQLA or initiating stablecoin redemptions.\n\n### 5.3 Independent Custody Arrangements\n*   All reserve assets must be held under custody with one or more Independent Custodians pre-approved by the Board's Risk & Compliance Committee.\n*   Custody agreements must clearly establish the segregation of assets, the custodian's fiduciary duty, and the prohibition of the custodian re-hypothecating or using the assets for its own purposes.\n*   Access to move or transfer reserve assets is restricted to a limited number of authorized personnel under a dual-control mechanism.\n\n### 5.4 Daily Independent Attestation\n*   An independent auditor, appointed by the Audit Committee, will perform a daily verification of the reserve balance and its composition.\n*   The auditor will have read-only access to relevant systems (custody accounts, issuance ledger) to perform their attestation.\n*   A daily attestation report will be published on the company's website by 09:00 UTC the following business day.\n\n### 5.5 Monthly Public Reporting\n*   The Compliance Department will prepare a detailed monthly Reserve Report for public disclosure.\n*   This report will include, at a minimum:\n    *   The total value of stablecoins in circulation as of the month-end date.\n    *   The total value and detailed breakdown of HQLA held in reserve.\n    *   The average reserve ratio for the month.\n    *   The name(s) of the Independent Custodian(s).\n    *   A link to the archive of daily attestations for that month.\n*   The report will be published on the company's website within 10 business days following the end of each calendar month.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n*   All personnel must adhere strictly to this policy. Non-compliance will result in disciplinary action.\n*   The Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) is responsible for overall policy implementation and monitoring.\n*   The Internal Audit function will conduct quarterly reviews to test the effectiveness of controls around reserve management and reporting.\n*   Any material deviation from the 1:1 reserve requirement, custody failure, or inability to produce an attestation must be escalated immediately to the CCO and CEO, and reported to the relevant competent authority as required by MiCA.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule\nThis policy shall be reviewed annually by the Legal and Compliance Departments to ensure ongoing alignment with MiCA requirements and other applicable regulations. Ad-hoc reviews will be triggered by any material change in regulatory requirements, business model, or following a significant control failure. All revisions require approval from the Board's Risk & Compliance Committee.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements\nThis policy is designed to ensure full compliance with, but not limited to, the following regulatory frameworks:\n*   **Primary Reference:** Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 on Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCA), specifically Title III regarding Asset-Referenced Tokens (ARTs), Articles 31-35 on reserve assets.\n*   **Applicable Territory:** The Canary Islands, as an outermost region of the European Union, where EU law, including MiCA, is fully applicable.\n*   **Supplementary Guidance:** Relevant technical standards, regulatory technical standards (RTS), and guidelines issued by the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) pertaining to reserve management and custody for stablecoin issuers.\n\n---\n**Policy Version:** 1.0  \n**Effective Date:** [Date]  \n**Approved By:** [Name/Title of Approver]\n```"

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Canary Islands\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-02-12T17:41:04.178189\n\n## Executive Summary\nCRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no documented policies addressing stablecoin regulation in the Canary Islands (EU jurisdiction). All fundamental regulatory requirements under MiCA and related EU financial regulations are completely unaddressed. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive compliance framework before any operations commence. The highest priority gaps are reserve requirements, licensing authorization, and AML/CFT compliance, which are prerequisites for legal operation. The company faces existential regulatory risk and cannot operate in its current state without facing severe enforcement actions.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must maintain 1:1 reserves in high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) as per EU's MiCA regulation (applicable in Canary Islands as EU territory)\n\n**Current Status:** No documented
