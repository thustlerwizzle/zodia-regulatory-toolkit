# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T19:25:15.365467

## Executive Summary
The company currently has no documented policies addressing Botswana's stablecoin regulatory requirements, resulting in complete non-compliance. Critical gaps exist in licensing, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance that must be addressed immediately to avoid severe regulatory consequences. The company should prioritize establishing a foundational compliance framework before commencing any stablecoin operations in Botswana. Given the evolving regulatory landscape for digital assets in Botswana, the company should also establish ongoing regulatory monitoring and engagement processes.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Legal authorization/licensing for stablecoin issuance or operation in Botswana

**Current Status:** No documented policy addressing licensing requirements

**Gap:** Company lacks policies for obtaining necessary regulatory approvals or licenses to operate stablecoin services in Botswana

**Impact:** Potential regulatory enforcement actions, fines, or complete shutdown of operations

**Recommendation:** Develop licensing strategy and policy framework; engage with Bank of Botswana to understand authorization requirements

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Reserve requirements and asset backing for stablecoins

**Current Status:** No documented reserve management policies

**Gap:** Missing policies governing reserve composition, custody, auditing, and redemption mechanisms

**Impact:** Risk of insolvency, loss of peg, regulatory sanctions, and loss of customer trust

**Recommendation:** Establish comprehensive reserve management policy with clear asset composition rules, custody arrangements, and regular independent audits

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance for digital asset services

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT policies for stablecoin operations

**Gap:** Lack of customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting procedures specific to stablecoins

**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties, reputational damage, and potential criminal liability

**Recommendation:** Develop AML/CFT program aligned with Botswana's Financial Intelligence Act and FATF recommendations for VASPs

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements

**Recommendation:** Create comprehensive consumer protection framework including clear disclosures, redemption guarantees, and dispute resolution procedures

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Cybersecurity and operational resilience standards

**Recommendation:** Implement cybersecurity framework specific to stablecoin operations including regular security audits and incident response plans
