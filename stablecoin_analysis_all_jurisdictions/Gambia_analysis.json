This represents a complete regulatory compliance failure across all major categories. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive compliance framework before any further operations. The absence of basic AML/CFT, reserve management, and consumer protection policies creates severe legal, financial, and reputational risks.

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Gambia\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-01-30T23:11:34.650012\n\n## Executive Summary\nCRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently operates with no documented policies for stablecoin operations in The Gambia or any jurisdiction. This represents a complete regulatory compliance failure across all major categories. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive compliance framework before any further operations. The absence of basic AML/CFT, reserve management, and consumer protection policies creates severe legal, financial, and reputational risks. Priority should be given to establishing foundational policies for licensing, reserves, and AML compliance before addressing governance and reporting requirements.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Legal framework for stablecoin issuance and operation\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policies exist\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of any policies addressing stablecoin operations, issuance, redemption, or reserve management\n\n**Impact:** Operating without any regulatory compliance framework exposes the company to legal sanctions, license revocation, fines, and reputational damage\n\n**Recommendation:** Immediately develop comprehensive stablecoin policy framework covering issuance, redemption, reserve management, and operational controls\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Reserve asset requirements and custody arrangements\n\n**Current Status:** No policies addressing reserve management\n\n**Gap:** No documentation on reserve composition, custody arrangements, segregation of assets, or audit requirements\n\n**Impact:** Risk of commingling funds, insufficient reserves, and inability to honor redemption requests, leading to loss of customer trust and regulatory enforcement\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish reserve management policy specifying asset types, custody requirements, segregation rules, and independent audit procedures\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance for stablecoin transactions\n\n**Current Status:** No AML/CFT policies documented\n\n**Gap:** Missing customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and record-keeping procedures\n\n**Impact:** Exposure to money laundering and terrorist financing risks, regulatory penalties, and potential criminal liability\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive AML/CFT program including KYC procedures, transaction monitoring, SAR filing, and staff training\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop consumer protection framework including clear disclosures, redemption rights, complaint procedures, and risk warnings\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish operational risk management framework covering cybersecurity, business continuity, incident response, and technical controls\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-006\n**Requirement:** Licensing and registration requirements\n\n**Recommendation:** Conduct licensing
