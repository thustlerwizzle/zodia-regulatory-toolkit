# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T21:47:29.496586

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits a complete absence of documented policies for stablecoin operations in Dominica, representing critical non-compliance with fundamental regulatory requirements. All core regulatory areas including licensing, reserve management, AML/CFT, and consumer protection lack any documented controls or procedures. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive compliance framework before any stablecoin operations can commence in Dominica. The current state poses severe regulatory, financial, and reputational risks that must be addressed as a matter of highest priority.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance requires licensing/registration with Dominica's financial regulator (Eastern Caribbean Central Bank or Financial Services Unit)

**Current Status:** No documented licensing or registration policy

**Gap:** Company lacks policies for obtaining necessary regulatory approvals to issue stablecoins in Dominica

**Impact:** Potential regulatory enforcement, fines, or prohibition from operating in Dominica

**Recommendation:** Develop regulatory engagement strategy and licensing application process for Dominica

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Stablecoin reserves must be fully backed and segregated from company assets

**Current Status:** No reserve management policy documented

**Gap:** Missing policies for reserve composition, custody, segregation, and regular attestation

**Impact:** Risk of insolvency, loss of customer funds, and regulatory sanctions

**Recommendation:** Create comprehensive reserve management policy with third-party custody and audit requirements

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting

**Current Status:** No AML/CFT policy documented

**Gap:** Complete absence of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls

**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, loss of banking relationships, and reputational damage

**Recommendation:** Implement full AML/CFT program aligned with FATF recommendations and Dominica's requirements

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive consumer protection framework with clear redemption mechanisms

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity requirements

**Recommendation:** Establish operational risk management framework with cybersecurity controls and incident response
