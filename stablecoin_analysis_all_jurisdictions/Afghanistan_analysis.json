Purpose and Scope  \n**Purpose:**  \nThis policy establishes an immediate, temporary suspension of all corporate stablecoin issuance, redemption, trading, and transactional operations involving Afghanistan, its territories, or its residents. The suspension is enacted to mitigate legal, regulatory, and financial crime risks arising from the current uncertain regulatory environment in Afghanistan. Concurrently, this policy mandates a comprehensive regulatory assessment to inform future operational decisions.\n\n**Scope:**  \nThis policy applies to all business units, subsidiaries, employees, contractors, and third-party partners engaged in the issuance, management, or facilitation of stablecoin activities with any nexus to Afghanistan. This includes, but is not limited to, services offered to Afghan residents, transactions routed through Afghan financial institutions, and partnerships with Afghan-based entities.\n\n## 3. Definitions  \n*   **Stablecoin:** A type of digital asset designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified reference asset or basket of assets (e.g., a fiat currency like the US Dollar).\n*   **Operations Involving Afghanistan:** Any activity where one counterparty is a natural person resident in Afghanistan, a legal entity registered in Afghanistan, or a transaction that transits the Afghan financial system.\n*   **Regulatory Landscape:** The collective body of applicable laws, regulations, directives, guidelines, and enforcement practices issued by Afghan authorities, including but not limited to Da Afghanistan Bank (the central bank).\n*   **Comprehensive Regulatory Research:** A systematic review and analysis of all publicly available and obtained legal and regulatory materials pertaining to financial services, digital assets, and anti-money laundering/counter-terrorist financing (AML/CFT) in Afghanistan.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement  \nIt is the policy of this organization to conduct all stablecoin operations in full compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Given the absence of a clear legal framework governing digital assets and stablecoins in Afghanistan, and the associated heightened risks, the company hereby suspends all stablecoin operations involving Afghanistan effective immediately. This suspension will remain in force until a thorough regulatory assessment is completed, risks are evaluated, and a subsequent, informed policy decision is made by the Legal and Compliance Executive Committee.\n\n## 5. Procedures  \n\n### 5.1. Immediate Suspension (Effective Upon Policy Issuance)\n1.  **Notification:** The Compliance Department will issue formal internal notifications to all relevant business unit heads and external notifications to affected partners.\n2.  **Platform & Service Modification:** The Technology Department will, within 24 hours:\n    *   Geoblock IP addresses originating from Afghanistan from accessing stablecoin issuance, trading, and redemption portals.\n    *   Suspend user account creation and transaction processing for customers identified as Afghan residents.\n    *   Implement transaction monitoring rules to flag and halt stablecoin transfers to/from known Afghan wallet addresses or service providers.\n3.  **Customer Communication:** The Communications Department, in coordination with Legal, will draft and disseminate clear notices to affected users, explaining the temporary suspension due to regulatory review.\n\n### 5.2. Comprehensive Regulatory Research\n1.  **Research Team:** The Legal Department will lead a working group comprising members from Compliance, International Risk, and Government Affairs.\n2.  **Research Parameters:** The team will investigate:\n    *   The current legal status of digital assets, cryptocurrencies, and stablecoins under Afghan law.\n    *   Da Afghanistan Bank's current directives and stance on virtual assets.\n    *   Existing financial services regulations, including licensing requirements.\n    *   AML/CFT laws and sanctions regimes applicable in Afghanistan.\n    *   Any proposed or draft legislation related to digital assets.\n    *   Reports from international bodies (FATF, IMF, World Bank) on Afghanistan's financial regulatory environment.\n3.  **Deliverable:** The team will produce a **Regulatory Assessment Report** within 60 days, containing:\n    *   Summary of findings.\n    *   Risk analysis (Legal, Regulatory, Reputational, AML/CFT).\n    *   Recommended next steps (permanent suspension, restricted re-engagement, full resumption).\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements  \n*   All personnel must adhere strictly to the suspension. Circumventing or ignoring the suspension is a violation of this policy and may result in disciplinary action.\n*   The Legal Department is responsible for maintaining records of the regulatory research and the final assessment report.\n*   The Compliance Department is responsible for monitoring the effectiveness of the technical controls and investigating any potential breaches of the suspension.\n*   Any inquiries from Afghan authorities or related entities must be directed immediately to the Legal Department—no independent engagement is permitted.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule  \n*   This policy is effective immediately upon publication.\n*   The policy and the suspension order will be formally reviewed within 10 business days following the completion and presentation of the **Regulatory Assessment Report**.\n*   The policy will be updated, extended, or rescinded based on the findings and recommendations of that report by the Legal and Compliance Executive Committee.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements  \nThis policy is promulgated pursuant to the company's overarching obligation to operate within a defined legal framework, as mandated by:\n*   **Internal Governance Requirement:** Corporate Charter, Section 5.1 (Legal Compliance).\n*   **External Regulatory Drivers:** General principles of international financial regulation, including the need for clarity on:\n    *   **Licensing and Authorization:** Uncertainty regarding permissible activities for stablecoin issuers and service providers.\n    *   **Consumer Protection:** Lack of visible frameworks for Afghan consumer redress and asset safeguarding.\n    *   **AML/CFT Compliance:** Elevated risks and potential inability to conduct adequate customer due diligence (CDD) and satisfy Know-Your-Customer (KYC) obligations in line with global standards.\n    *   **Sanctions Compliance:** Heightened complexity in ensuring operations do not violate international sanctions regimes applicable to Afghanistan.\n```\n*This document is a policy instrument and does not constitute legal advice. Legal counsel should be consulted for jurisdiction-specific matters.*"

Compliance Requirements  \n*   All personnel must adhere strictly to the suspension. Circumventing or ignoring the suspension is a violation of this policy and may result in disciplinary action.\n*   The Legal Department is responsible for maintaining records of the regulatory research and the final assessment report.\n*   The Compliance Department is responsible for monitoring the effectiveness of the technical controls and investigating any potential breaches of the suspension.\n*   Any inquiries from Afghan authorities or related entities must be directed immediately to the Legal Department—no independent engagement is permitted.\n\n## 7.

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Afghanistan\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-01-30T05:02:51.383484\n\n## Executive Summary\nCRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company appears to have no established policies for stablecoin operations in Afghanistan or for serving Afghan customers. This represents an extreme compliance risk given Afghanistan's complex regulatory environment, international sanctions regime, and high-risk financial crime profile. Immediate action is required to suspend operations and develop comprehensive compliance frameworks before any further business activities involving Afghanistan can be considered. The complete absence of policies across all regulatory domains indicates either a new market entry without proper preparation or a significant oversight in compliance program development.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Legal framework for stablecoin issuance and operation\n\n**Current Status:** No policies identified\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing stablecoin operations in Afghanistan or for Afghan customers\n\n**Impact:** Legal exposure, potential regulatory enforcement actions, inability to operate legally in Afghanistan\n\n**Recommendation:** Immediately suspend all stablecoin operations involving Afghanistan until regulatory landscape is clarified. Conduct comprehensive regulatory research on Afghanistan's financial regulations, central bank directives, and any existing or proposed digital asset frameworks.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance for digital assets\n\n**Current Status:** No policies identified\n\n**Gap:** No anti-money laundering or counter-terrorism financing policies specific to stablecoin transactions\n\n**Impact:** High risk of facilitating illicit financial flows, potential sanctions violations, reputational damage\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive AML/CFT policies for stablecoin operations including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and sanctions screening specific to Afghanistan's risk profile.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Licensing and registration requirements\n\n**Current Status:** No policies identified\n\n**Gap:** No policies addressing licensing requirements for operating in Afghanistan or serving Afghan customers\n\n**Impact:** Operating without required licenses, potential criminal liability, asset seizure\n\n**Recommendation:** Conduct immediate legal assessment of licensing requirements in Afghanistan. Engage local legal counsel to determine if stablecoin operations require money transmitter, payment service provider, or other financial licenses.\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Reserve requirements and transparency\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish reserve management policies requiring 1:1 backing with high-quality liquid assets, independent custody arrangements, and regular public attestations of reserve holdings.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement consumer protection policies including clear terms of service, redemption rights, fee transparency, and complaint resolution mechanisms.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-006\n**Requirement:** Cross-border transaction compliance\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop cross-border transaction policies including geographic restrictions, sanctions compliance checks, and reporting requirements for transactions involving Afghanistan.\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **legal_framework_for_stablecoins**: not_met\n❌ **aml_cft_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **reserve_requirements**: not_met\n❌ **consumer_protection**: not_met\n❌ **licensing_requirements**: not_met\n❌ **cross_border_compliance**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update Summary\nGenerated: 2026-01-30T05:03:24.732639\n\n## Overview\nThis document summarizes proposed updates to company policies and standards based on regulatory gap analysis.\n\n## New Policies Required\n\n## Modified Policies\n\n### GAP-001\n**Category:** Legal\n**Current Policy:** No policies identified\n**Proposed Change:** Immediately suspend all stablecoin operations involving Afghanistan until regulatory landscape is clarified.
