# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-31T00:49:44.093006

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits a complete absence of documented policies and frameworks necessary for stablecoin regulation compliance in Ireland. All critical regulatory requirements are unmet, creating significant legal, operational, and reputational risks. Immediate action is required to develop comprehensive compliance frameworks, with priority given to authorization requirements, capital adequacy, customer fund safeguarding, and AML/CTF compliance. The company should engage legal and compliance experts familiar with Irish and EU financial regulations to develop and implement necessary policies before commencing any stablecoin-related operations.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Authorization requirement for electronic money institutions (EMIs) or payment institutions issuing stablecoins under EU Electronic Money Directive (EMD2) and Payment Services Directive (PSD2)

**Current Status:** No documented policy for regulatory authorization or licensing

**Gap:** Company lacks policies addressing the need for formal authorization from the Central Bank of Ireland or relevant EU authorities to issue stablecoins

**Impact:** Legal prohibition from operating, potential fines, enforcement actions, and reputational damage

**Recommendation:** Develop and implement a regulatory authorization framework that includes: 1) Assessment of whether stablecoin qualifies as e-money under EMD2 2) Application process for EMI or PI license 3) Ongoing license maintenance procedures

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Capital requirements and prudential safeguards under EU regulations (EMD2, PSD2, and upcoming Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation - MiCA)

**Current Status:** No documented capital adequacy or prudential risk management policies

**Gap:** Absence of policies addressing minimum capital requirements, own funds calculations, and prudential safeguards for stablecoin issuance

**Impact:** Regulatory non-compliance, insufficient financial resilience, potential insolvency risks, and supervisory intervention

**Recommendation:** Establish capital adequacy framework including: 1) Minimum capital calculation methodology 2) Capital conservation buffer policies 3) Regular capital adequacy assessments 4) Stress testing procedures

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Safeguarding of customer funds requirements under Article 7 of EMD2 and PSD2

**Current Status:** No documented customer fund safeguarding policies

**Gap:** Missing policies for segregation of customer funds, protection against insolvency, and appropriate safeguarding arrangements

**Impact:** Loss of customer funds in insolvency, regulatory sanctions, loss of customer trust, and potential civil liability

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive safeguarding framework: 1) Segregation of customer funds in separate accounts 2) Daily reconciliation procedures 3) Insolvency protection mechanisms 4) Regular auditing of safeguarding arrangements

### Gap 4: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance under Irish Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Acts and EU AML Directives

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CTF policies or procedures

**Gap:** Complete absence of AML/CTF framework including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting

**Impact:** Criminal liability, substantial fines, regulatory enforcement, and reputational damage

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive AML/CTF program: 1) Risk-based customer due diligence procedures 2) Transaction monitoring system 3) Suspicious activity reporting protocols 4) Designated compliance officer appointment 5) Regular staff training

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Consumer protection requirements including transparency, disclosure, and complaint handling under EU and Irish consumer protection laws

**Recommendation:** Establish consumer protection framework: 1) Clear disclosure documents 2) Fair terms and conditions 3) Transparent fee structure 4) Formal complaint handling procedure 5) Redress mechanisms

### Gap 2: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity requirements under EU Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) and Central Bank of Ireland expectations

**Recommendation:** Implement operational resilience framework: 1) ICT risk management program 2) Incident response plan 3) Business continuity and disaster recovery plans 4) Third-party service provider oversight 5) Regular testing and updating

### Gap 3: GAP-007
**Requirement:** Governance and risk management requirements including fit and proper assessments for management under Central Bank of Ireland requirements
