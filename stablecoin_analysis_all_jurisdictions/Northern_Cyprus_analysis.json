Policy Title\nLegal Authorization and Jurisdictional Risk Assessment Policy for Stablecoin Issuance in Northern Cyprus\n\n## 2. Purpose and Scope\n### 2.1 Purpose\nThis policy establishes a structured framework to ensure that any potential or existing stablecoin issuance activities by the organization are conducted only after obtaining clear legal authorization and completing a comprehensive jurisdictional risk assessment. The policy aims to mitigate legal, regulatory, and reputational risks associated with operating in the complex jurisdictional environment of Northern Cyprus.\n\n### 2.2 Scope\nThis policy applies to all departments, subsidiaries, and personnel of the organization involved in or considering:\n*   The issuance, promotion, or management of stablecoins or related digital asset services.\n*   Strategic planning for market entry or expansion into Northern Cyprus (Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus - TRNC).\n*   Legal, compliance, and risk management functions overseeing such activities.\n\n## 3. Definitions\n*   **Stablecoin:** A type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified asset or a pool of assets, typically a fiat currency like the Turkish Lira, Euro, or US Dollar.\n*   **TRNC:** The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, a *de facto* state recognized only by Turkey.\n*   **Applicable Regulatory Framework:** The body of laws, regulations, and directives that may govern financial services, electronic money, payment systems, and securities within the relevant jurisdiction(s) impacting operations in Northern Cyprus.\n*   **Jurisdictional Risk:** The potential for legal, regulatory, or political complications arising from the unique and contested international status of Northern Cyprus, including but not limited to recognition issues, enforcement challenges, and conflicting legal systems.\n*   **Local Legal Counsel:** A qualified law firm or practitioner licensed to practice and with substantive expertise in the TRNC legal system.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\nIt is the policy of this organization that **no stablecoin issuance or related operational activity shall be conducted in or targeted from Northern Cyprus until a formal Legal Authorization Clearance is obtained.** The organization is committed to the highest standards of legal compliance and risk management. Given the absence of a documented policy and the complex legal status of Northern Cyprus, a proactive, cautious, and evidence-based approach is mandatory. All activities must be preceded by a rigorous legal analysis and risk assessment process as outlined in this document.\n\n## 5. Procedures\nTo achieve the policy objectives, the following procedures must be sequentially followed:\n\n### 5.1 Phase 1: Comprehensive Legal Analysis\n1.  **Objective:** Determine the precise applicable regulatory framework.\n2.  **Action:** The Legal Department shall commission and oversee a detailed analysis examining:\n    *   The applicability of Turkish national law (given Turkey's exclusive recognition of the TRNC).\n    *   Potential indirect influence of EU financial services regulations (e.g., MiCA - Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation) due to cross-border implications and interactions with EU-based entities.\n    *   The specific laws, decrees, and regulatory guidelines enacted by the TRNC authorities governing financial services, electronic money, securities, and anti-money laundering (AML).\n    *   The legal status of digital asset issuance and the powers of any existing or prospective TRNC regulatory body.\n\n### 5.2 Phase 2: Engagement of Local Legal Counsel\n1.  **Objective:** Secure expert, on-the-ground legal guidance.\n2.  **Action:** Concurrent with or immediately following Phase 1, the Legal Department must engage a reputable Local Legal Counsel in Northern Cyprus. This counsel will:\n    *   Validate and supplement the initial legal analysis.\n    *   Provide ongoing advice on the interpretation and application of TRNC law.\n    *   Interface with local authorities, if necessary and prudent.\n    *   Advise on corporate structuring and licensing requirements within the TRNC.\n\n### 5.3 Phase 3: Jurisdictional Risk Assessment\n1.  **Objective:** Systematically identify, evaluate, and document all jurisdictional risks.\n2.  **Action:** The Risk Management Department, in collaboration with Legal, shall develop and execute a formal **Jurisdictional Risk Assessment Policy** (a sub-policy to this document). This assessment must cover:\n    *   **Political & Recognition Risk:** Risks from the lack of international recognition, including challenges in enforcing contracts, accessing international banking, and potential for sudden policy shifts.\n    *   **Regulatory Arbitrage & Compliance Risk:** Risks of operating in a potentially under-developed regulatory regime and the resulting scrutiny from other jurisdictions.\n    *   **Reputational Risk:** Risks associated with operating in a geopolitically sensitive area.\n    *   **Financial Crime Risk:** Enhanced AML/CFT (Combating the Financing of Terrorism) risks and the robustness of local compliance infrastructure.\n    *   **Exit Risk:** Difficulties in winding down operations or repatriating capital.\n\n### 5.4 Phase 4: Decision-Making & Operational Hold\n1.  **Objective:** Make an informed, governance-approved decision on proceeding.\n2.  **Action:**\n    *   A mandatory operational hold on all Northern Cyprus-related stablecoin activities is imposed effective immediately upon adoption of this policy.\n    *   The findings from Phases 1-3 must be compiled into a **Legal and Risk Assessment Dossier**.\n    *   This Dossier will be presented to the organization's Executive Committee and Board of Directors (or designated sub-committee).\n    *   The Board will issue a formal **Legal Authorization Clearance** only if the Dossier conclusively demonstrates: (a) a viable and stable legal pathway for authorized operation, and (b) that identified jurisdictional risks are acceptable, mitigated, or within the organization's risk appetite.\n    *   **No operations may commence without this Clearance.**\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n*   All employees and contractors are required to adhere to this policy.\n*   The Legal Department is responsible for enforcing the operational hold and managing the analysis phases.\n*   Failure to comply with this policy, including any attempt to circumvent the operational hold, will be considered a serious violation of company rules and may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.\n*   Any inquiries or potential opportunities related to Northern Cyprus must be immediately escalated to the Head of Legal and the Chief Risk Officer.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule\nThis policy shall be reviewed and updated:\n*   **Annually** as part of the standard policy review cycle.\n*   **Immediately** upon any material change in the legal or political status of Northern Cyprus.\n*   **Immediately** upon the issuance of a Legal Authorization Clearance, to transition from a pre-authorization to an active operations framework.\n*   **Immediately** if new international regulations (e.g., EU MiCA) significantly alter the risk landscape.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements\nThis policy is designed to address the following regulatory and risk imperatives:\n*   **Primary Regulatory Uncertainty:** The lack of a clear, documented regulatory framework for stablecoin issuance within Northern Cyprus.\n*   **Potential Applicable Regimes:**\n    *   Laws of the Republic of Turkey (potential extraterritorial application).\n    *   Legislation of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC).\n    *   EU Regulations (e.g., MiCA Regulation (EU) 2023/1114) for any cross-border activity into the European Economic Area.\n    *   Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Recommendations on Virtual Assets and VASPs, which may influence TRNC's AML/CFT laws.\n*   **Corporate Governance Duty:** The duty of the Board and management to operate within the law and exercise due care in assessing material risks to the organization.\n\n---\n**Policy Version:** 1.0  \n**Effective Date:** [Date of Board Approval]  \n**Approved By:** [Board of Directors/Executive Committee]  \n**Owner:** Legal Department & Risk Management Department\n```"

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Northern Cyprus\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-02-12T18:01:19.821994\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company appears to have no documented policies addressing stablecoin regulation in Northern Cyprus, resulting in critical compliance gaps across all regulatory domains. The unique political status of Northern Cyprus creates additional complexity, as it is not internationally recognized, making jurisdictional determination challenging. All identified gaps are rated as critical or high priority due to the fundamental nature of the missing policies. Immediate action is required to establish basic compliance frameworks before any stablecoin operations can be considered. The company should prioritize obtaining legal clarity on applicable regulations, implementing AML/CTF controls, and addressing licensing requirements before developing operational policies.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Legal authorization to issue stablecoins in Northern Cyprus\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found\n\n**Gap:** Northern Cyprus (Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus) is not internationally recognized, creating legal uncertainty about which regulatory framework applies. There is no clear policy addressing whether the company can legally operate stablecoin services in this jurisdiction.\n\n**Impact:** Operating without proper authorization could result in legal action, fines, seizure of assets, and reputational damage. The lack of international recognition creates significant jurisdictional risks.\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Conduct comprehensive legal analysis to determine applicable regulatory framework (Turkish law, potential EU influence, or local TRNC regulations). 2. Engage local legal counsel in Northern Cyprus. 3. Develop a jurisdictional risk assessment policy. 4. Consider suspending operations until legal clarity is obtained.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found\n\n**Gap:** No evidence of AML/CTF policies, procedures, or controls specific to stablecoin operations in Northern Cyprus. This includes lack of customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and record-keeping requirements.\n\n**Impact:** High risk of regulatory sanctions, financial penalties, loss of banking relationships, and potential criminal liability for facilitating illicit financial activities.\n\n**Recommendation:** 1.
