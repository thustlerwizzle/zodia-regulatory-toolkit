# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T05:15:08.436939

## Executive Summary
Overall compliance status is severely deficient. The company currently has no policies addressing the core regulatory requirements for stablecoin issuance or operation, particularly in light of Algeria's prohibitive stance. The most critical gap (GAP-001) is the lack of acknowledgment and mitigation for operating in a prohibited jurisdiction. Even for potential operations in other markets, the absence of foundational AML/CFT, consumer protection, and risk management policies represents a high-risk, non-compliant position. Immediate and comprehensive policy development is required before any stablecoin-related activity can be considered.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Legal authorization to issue or operate stablecoins in Algeria

**Current Status:** No documented policy exists

**Gap:** Algerian law (Financial Law 2023) prohibits the use, holding, or trading of cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins. The company lacks any policy acknowledging this blanket prohibition or establishing procedures to ensure compliance with it.

**Impact:** Operating in Algeria without acknowledging this prohibition exposes the company to severe legal penalties, including fines, criminal charges for executives, and complete cessation of operations. It represents a fundamental legal non-compliance.

**Recommendation:** Immediately draft and implement a 'Geographic Restrictions Policy' that explicitly prohibits the offering, marketing, sale, or facilitation of stablecoin services to residents or entities within Algeria. Implement IP-based geoblocking and customer onboarding checks for Algerian jurisdiction.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CFT) frameworks specific to virtual assets

**Recommendation:** Develop a comprehensive 'AML/CFT Policy for Digital Assets' aligned with FATF Recommendations (especially Recommendation 15). This must include Risk-Based Approach (RBA), Customer Due Diligence (CDD) and Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) for stablecoin users, wallet screening, transaction monitoring rules, and SAR procedures.

### Gap 2: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements for stablecoin issuers

**Recommendation:** Create a 'Stablecoin Issuance and Disclosure Policy' mandating regular, audited public attestations of reserves, clear terms of service outlining redemption mechanisms, and prominent risk disclosures to all potential and existing users.

### Gap 3: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Operational risk management and technology governance

**Recommendation:** Implement an 'Operational Risk Framework for Digital Assets'. Key components should include a smart contract security audit protocol, a rigorous custodian selection and oversight policy, a comprehensive cybersecurity program, and a disaster recovery/business continuity plan specific to stablecoin operations.
