# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-31T00:21:24.203285

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no documented policies addressing Hungarian stablecoin regulations. All regulatory requirements are unmet, creating severe legal and operational risks. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive regulatory compliance framework before any stablecoin operations can commence in Hungary. The highest priority gaps involve licensing, capital/reserve requirements, and AML/CTF compliance, which are fundamental to legal operation. Given the upcoming MiCA regulation implementation in 2024, the company should develop policies that address both current Hungarian requirements and future EU-wide standards simultaneously.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Hungary's regulatory framework for stablecoins under Act CCXXXVII of 2013 on Credit Institutions and Financial Enterprises, and EU regulations (MiCA - Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation coming into effect 2024). Requirements include licensing, capital requirements, governance, redemption rights, reserve management, and consumer protection.

**Current Status:** No documented stablecoin-specific policies identified

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing stablecoin issuance, management, redemption, reserve backing, or regulatory reporting requirements for Hungarian operations

**Impact:** Legal prohibition of stablecoin operations in Hungary, potential regulatory enforcement actions, fines, reputational damage, and inability to operate legally

**Recommendation:** Immediately develop comprehensive stablecoin policy framework aligned with Hungarian financial regulations and upcoming MiCA requirements, including licensing strategy, governance structure, reserve management protocols, and consumer protection measures

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Financial institution licensing requirements for stablecoin issuers under Hungarian National Bank (MNB) supervision

**Current Status:** No licensing strategy or compliance documentation

**Gap:** Missing licensing application procedures, regulatory engagement strategy, and ongoing compliance monitoring for financial institution status

**Impact:** Inability to legally issue or manage stablecoins in Hungary, regulatory shutdown of operations, criminal liability for unauthorized financial services

**Recommendation:** Develop licensing roadmap, engage Hungarian legal counsel specializing in financial regulation, prepare application documentation, and establish MNB communication protocols

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Capital adequacy and reserve requirements for stablecoin issuers (minimum capital, liquid asset reserves, segregation of funds)

**Current Status:** No capital or reserve management policies

**Gap:** Absence of policies governing minimum capital requirements, reserve composition, asset segregation, and liquidity management for stablecoin backing

**Impact:** Regulatory non-compliance, inability to meet redemption requests, potential insolvency, loss of consumer trust, regulatory intervention

**Recommendation:** Establish reserve management policy specifying asset types, diversification requirements, custody arrangements, and regular attestation/audit procedures

### Gap 4: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance under Hungarian AML Act and EU directives

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CTF program for stablecoin operations

**Gap:** Missing risk assessment, customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and record-keeping procedures specific to stablecoin transactions

**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, criminal liability, loss of banking relationships, inclusion in regulatory blacklists

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive AML/CTF program including risk-based customer verification, transaction monitoring systems, reporting procedures to Hungarian Financial Intelligence Unit, and staff training

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including redemption rights, disclosures, and complaint handling

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive consumer protection framework including redemption policy, disclosure requirements, complaint handling procedures, and Hungarian-language documentation

### Gap 2: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Governance and risk management requirements including board oversight, internal controls, and audit trails

**Recommendation:** Establish governance framework with clear board responsibilities, risk committee oversight, internal audit function, and comprehensive control environment

### Gap 3: GAP-007
**Requirement:** Reporting and transparency obligations to Hungarian National Bank and other regulators

**Recommendation:** Develop regulatory reporting calendar, designate compliance officer for Hungarian operations, implement reporting workflows, and establish regulator communication protocols

### Gap 4: GAP-008
**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity requirements for financial institutions

**Recommendation:** Implement operational resilience framework including business continuity planning, cybersecurity controls, incident response procedures, and regular testing
