All critical regulatory requirements are unmet, creating severe legal, financial, and reputational risks. Immediate action is required to establish basic compliance frameworks before any stablecoin operations can commence.

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Jamaica\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-01-31T06:01:10.202354\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company currently has no documented policies addressing stablecoin regulation in Jamaica, representing a complete compliance failure. All critical regulatory requirements are unmet, creating severe legal, financial, and reputational risks. Immediate action is required to establish basic compliance frameworks before any stablecoin operations can commence. The highest priority gaps relate to legal authorization, reserve management, and AML/CTF compliance, which are fundamental to lawful operation. The company should consider engaging local Jamaican legal and compliance experts to navigate the specific regulatory landscape, as stablecoin regulation in Jamaica is evolving under the Bank of Jamaica's oversight of digital payment services.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Legal authorization and licensing for stablecoin issuance and operations in Jamaica\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy exists\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing the legal framework required to operate stablecoin services in Jamaica. No licensing strategy, regulatory engagement plan, or legal authorization framework.\n\n**Impact:** Operating without proper authorization could result in regulatory enforcement actions, fines, license revocation, criminal liability, and reputational damage.\n\n**Recommendation:** Immediately establish a regulatory engagement team to research and apply for necessary licenses under the Bank of Jamaica's regulatory framework for digital payment services and stablecoins.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Reserve requirements and asset backing for stablecoins\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy exists\n\n**Gap:** No policies governing the composition, custody, auditing, or transparency of reserve assets backing stablecoins as required by Jamaican regulators.\n\n**Impact:** Failure to maintain adequate reserves could lead to insolvency, loss of consumer funds, regulatory sanctions, and loss of market confidence.\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop and implement a comprehensive reserve management policy specifying asset types, custody arrangements, regular independent audits, and public disclosure requirements.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy exists\n\n**Gap:** No AML/CTF program tailored to stablecoin operations, including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and compliance with Jamaica's Proceeds of Crime Act.\n\n**Impact:** Significant risk of regulatory penalties, criminal prosecution, loss of banking relationships, and inclusion on international watchlists.\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement a risk-based AML/CTF program including KYC procedures, transaction monitoring systems, suspicious activity reporting protocols, and designated compliance officer.\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements\n\n**Recommendation:** Create comprehensive consumer protection policies including clear terms of service, risk disclosures, redemption procedures, fee schedules, and complaint handling processes.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish an operational risk management framework covering cybersecurity standards, business continuity planning, technology governance, and vendor management for critical service providers.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-006\n**Requirement:** Reporting and transparency obligations to regulators\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop a regulatory reporting calendar and procedures for all required submissions to Jamaican authorities, including financial, operational, and incident reports.\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **legal_authorization_licensing**: not_met\n❌ **reserve_requirements**: not_met\n❌ **aml_ctf_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **consumer_protection**: not_met\n❌
