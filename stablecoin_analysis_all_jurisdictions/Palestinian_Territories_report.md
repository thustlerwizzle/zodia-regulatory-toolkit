# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-12T18:50:52.725195

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no documented policies addressing stablecoin operations in Palestinian Territories. This represents a complete regulatory vacuum with severe operational and legal risks. All fundamental regulatory requirements are unmet. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive compliance framework before any operations commence. Priority should be given to establishing legal foundation, AML/CTF controls, and consumer protection measures. The company should not engage in any stablecoin-related activities until these critical gaps are addressed.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Legal framework for stablecoin issuance and operation in Palestinian Territories

**Current Status:** No documented policy exists

**Gap:** Complete absence of any policy addressing stablecoin operations in Palestinian Territories. No legal analysis, licensing requirements, or operational guidelines are established.

**Impact:** Operating without understanding legal requirements exposes company to regulatory enforcement, fines, license revocation, and potential criminal liability. Business operations could be immediately halted.

**Recommendation:** 1. Conduct comprehensive legal research on Palestinian financial regulations. 2. Engage local legal counsel specializing in financial technology. 3. Develop a foundational policy addressing legal status, licensing requirements, and prohibited activities.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance specific to digital assets

**Current Status:** No documented policy exists

**Gap:** No AML/CTF program tailored to stablecoin operations. Missing customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and record-keeping requirements.

**Impact:** High risk of facilitating illicit financial activities, leading to severe regulatory penalties, reputational damage, and potential inclusion on sanctions lists.

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop comprehensive AML/CTF policy following FATF recommendations for virtual assets. 2. Implement customer identification program (CIP) and enhanced due diligence for high-risk customers. 3. Establish transaction monitoring system for suspicious patterns.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements

**Recommendation:** 1. Create clear terms of service and user agreements. 2. Develop comprehensive risk disclosure documents. 3. Establish formal complaint handling and dispute resolution procedures.

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Reserve management and transparency requirements

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop reserve management policy specifying eligible assets and custody arrangements. 2. Establish regular third-party audit requirements. 3. Create public disclosure framework for reserve status.

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop comprehensive cybersecurity framework. 2. Establish incident response and business continuity plans. 3. Implement regular security testing and vulnerability assessments.
