# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T06:12:36.492459

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits significant regulatory compliance gaps across all major areas of Bahamian stablecoin regulation. The current policy framework is essentially non-existent, creating critical vulnerabilities in licensing, reserve management, AML/CFT compliance, and consumer protection. Immediate action is required to develop comprehensive policies and procedures to meet the requirements of The Bahamas' DARE Act and associated regulations. Priority should be given to licensing applications, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance to mitigate the highest risks of regulatory enforcement and operational failure. The company is currently non-compliant and should not engage in stablecoin issuance activities until these fundamental gaps are addressed.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Licensing requirement for stablecoin issuers under the Digital Assets and Registered Exchanges (DARE) Act 2020

**Current Status:** No documented licensing policy or application process

**Gap:** Company lacks policies addressing the mandatory licensing framework for stablecoin issuance in The Bahamas, including application requirements, capital adequacy, and ongoing regulatory reporting

**Impact:** Operating without proper licensing could result in regulatory enforcement actions, fines, business suspension, and reputational damage

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive licensing policy outlining application process, documentation requirements, capital requirements, and engagement strategy with the Securities Commission of The Bahamas

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Full backing requirement with high-quality liquid assets (Bahamian dollars, foreign currency, or other approved assets)

**Current Status:** No documented reserve management policy

**Gap:** Missing policies governing reserve composition, custody arrangements, segregation of assets, and regular attestation/audit requirements

**Impact:** Failure to maintain proper reserves could lead to insolvency risk, loss of customer funds, and regulatory sanctions including license revocation

**Recommendation:** Establish reserve management policy specifying eligible assets, custody arrangements, segregation requirements, and third-party attestation procedures

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (CFT) compliance under Bahamian regulations

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT policies

**Gap:** Missing customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and record-keeping procedures required for virtual asset service providers

**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, potential criminal liability, loss of banking relationships, and inclusion on international watchlists

**Recommendation:** Establish comprehensive AML/CFT program including KYC procedures, transaction monitoring systems, suspicious activity reporting protocols, and staff training

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Redemption rights at par value for stablecoin holders

**Recommendation:** Create redemption policy detailing procedures, timelines, fees, customer communication protocols, and contingency plans for high-volume redemption scenarios

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Transparency and disclosure requirements including regular reporting of reserve composition

**Recommendation:** Implement disclosure framework including monthly reserve attestations, quarterly financial reporting, and public transparency dashboard

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Risk management framework including operational, liquidity, and cybersecurity risks

**Recommendation:** Develop enterprise-wide risk management framework with specific modules for stablecoin operations, including stress testing, incident response, and business continuity planning

### Gap 4: GAP-008
**Requirement:** Governance requirements including board oversight and senior management responsibility

**Recommendation:** Establish governance framework with board-level oversight committee, clear management responsibilities, and regular compliance reporting to the board
