# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-12T18:19:47.351102

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no policies addressing stablecoin operations in Transnistria, representing a complete regulatory compliance failure. All fundamental regulatory requirements for stablecoin issuance and operation are unmet. Immediate action is required to: 1) Suspend any current operations until regulatory clarity is obtained, 2) Conduct comprehensive regulatory research on Transnistria's specific requirements, 3) Develop a complete compliance framework before resuming operations. The absence of basic policies for legal authorization, reserve management, AML/CTF, and consumer protection creates severe legal, financial, and reputational risks.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Legal recognition and authorization to issue stablecoins in Transnistria

**Current Status:** No policy exists regarding stablecoin operations in Transnistria

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing the legal framework for stablecoin issuance, operation, or compliance in Transnistria

**Impact:** Operating without legal authorization could result in regulatory enforcement, fines, business shutdown, and reputational damage

**Recommendation:** Immediately suspend any stablecoin operations in Transnistria until legal research confirms regulatory requirements and develop authorization policies

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Reserve requirements and asset backing for stablecoins

**Current Status:** No documented reserve management or asset backing policies

**Gap:** Missing policies governing reserve composition, custody, auditing, and redemption mechanisms required for stablecoin operations

### Gap 3: GAP-003

**Gap:** Missing customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and record-keeping requirements specific to stablecoin transactions

**Impact:** Exposure to financial crime risks, regulatory penalties, loss of banking relationships, and potential criminal liability

**Recommendation:** Implement stablecoin-specific AML/CTF program including: 1) Customer identification and verification, 2) Transaction monitoring thresholds, 3) Suspicious activity reporting procedures, 4) Travel rule compliance for cross-border transactions

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements

**Recommendation:** Develop consumer protection framework including: 1) Clear risk disclosures, 2) Terms of service documentation, 3) Redemption process transparency, 4) Complaint resolution procedures, 5) Educational materials for users

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity

**Recommendation:** Establish operational risk management framework including: 1) Smart contract security audits, 2) Cryptographic key management, 3) System redundancy requirements, 4) Incident response plan, 5) Business continuity testing

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Reporting and transparency obligations

**Recommendation:** Implement reporting framework including: 1) Regulatory reporting schedules, 2) Public reserve attestations, 3) Financial statement disclosures, 4) Incident reporting protocols
