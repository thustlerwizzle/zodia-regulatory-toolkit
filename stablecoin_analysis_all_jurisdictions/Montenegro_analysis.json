Policy Title\nInterim Regulatory Monitoring and Policy Framework for Stablecoin Activities in Montenegro\n\n## 2. Purpose and Scope\n\n### 2.1 Purpose\nThis policy establishes an immediate regulatory monitoring system and interim legal framework for the issuance, offering, trading, and custody of stablecoins within Montenegro. The purpose is to:\n- Provide legal certainty and consumer protection in the absence of specific national legislation.\n- Mitigate financial stability risks, market integrity risks, and money laundering risks associated with stablecoin activities.\n- Align Montenegro's regulatory approach with evolving international standards, using the European Union's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) as a primary benchmark.\n- Create a structured process for monitoring the stablecoin market and developing permanent national regulations.\n\n### 2.2 Scope\nThis policy applies to:\n- All natural and legal persons issuing, offering to the public, or seeking admission to trading of stablecoins within Montenegro.\n- All crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) involved in the trading, exchange, custody, or administration of stablecoins for clients in Montenegro.\n- Credit institutions and other financial entities engaging in stablecoin-related activities.\n- The relevant Montenegrin regulatory and supervisory authorities tasked with monitoring this sector.\n\n*Note:* This interim framework covers all types of stablecoins, with particular emphasis on significant asset-referenced tokens (ARTs) and e-money tokens (EMTs) as defined in the benchmark framework.\n\n## 3. Definitions\n\n- **Stablecoin:** A type of crypto-asset that purports to maintain a stable value by referencing to the value of one or several fiat currencies, commodities, crypto-assets, or a combination thereof.\n- **Asset-Referenced Token (ART):** A type of stablecoin that is not an e-money token and purports to maintain a stable value by referencing to any other value or right, including one or several official currencies.\n- **E-Money Token (EMT):** A type of stablecoin that purports to maintain a stable value by referencing the value of one official currency.\n- **Crypto-Asset Service Provider (CASP):** Any person whose occupation or business is the provision of one or more crypto-asset services to third parties on a professional basis.\n- **Issuer:** A legal person who offers to the public or seeks admission to trading of a stablecoin.\n- **MiCA:** Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 May 2023 on Markets in Crypto-Assets.\n- **Regulatory Monitoring System:** The structured process of data collection, risk assessment, and market surveillance implemented by Montenegrin authorities to oversee stablecoin activities.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\n\nThe Government of Montenegro, through its competent authorities, hereby establishes an interim regulatory posture for stablecoins. Until a comprehensive national law on crypto-assets is enacted, all stablecoin-related activities within Montenegrin jurisdiction shall be conducted with reference to the principles and key requirements of the EU's MiCA regulation.\n\nThis is not a direct transposition of MiCA but a principled adoption of its core regulatory objectives: consumer and investor protection, market integrity, financial stability, and the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing. All market participants are expected to adhere to the spirit and key operational requirements of this benchmark framework. The authorities will monitor compliance and may take supervisory action against activities that pose significant risk, even in the absence of specific national rules.\n\n## 5. Procedures\n\n### 5.1 Establishment of the Regulatory Monitoring System (RMS)\n1.  **Lead Authority:** The Ministry of Finance, in collaboration with the Central Bank of Montenegro (if applicable) and the relevant financial supervisory authority, shall establish an inter-agency RMS Working Group.\n2.  **Data Collection:** The RMS will implement a quarterly reporting requirement for all known stablecoin issuers and CASPs operating in Montenegro. Reports must include:\n    - Nature and volume of activities.\n    - Reserve asset composition and audit reports (for issuers).\n    - Consumer complaint statistics.\n        - Operational risk assessments.\n3.  **Market Surveillance:** Authorities will actively monitor public offers, marketing communications, and trading platforms for misleading claims, market abuse, or fraudulent activity related to stablecoins.\n4.  **Risk Assessment:** The RMS Working Group will produce a bi-annual risk assessment report on the stablecoin ecosystem in Montenegro, identifying emerging vulnerabilities and informing the development of permanent legislation.\n\n### 5.2 Interim Regulatory Expectations for Market Participants\n1.  **For Stablecoin Issuers:**\n    - **Authorization Expectation:** Entities planning to issue significant stablecoins are strongly advised to engage in pre-issuance consultations with the Montenegrin authorities and demonstrate how they meet key MiCA-like requirements (e.g., governance, reserve management, redemption rights, whitepaper disclosures).\n    - **Transparency:** All issuers must publish detailed, clear, and non-misleading whitepapers or equivalent disclosure documents for their stablecoin.\n    - **Reserve Management:** Issuers of fiat-referenced stablecoins must hold reserve assets in secure, segregated accounts, with a 1:1 backing principle, and subject to regular independent audit.\n2.  **For Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs):**\n    - **Conduct of Business:** CASPs must act honestly, fairly, and professionally in the best interests of their clients. Clear information on risks, costs, and terms of service must be provided.\n    - **Safeguarding of Client Assets:** Client funds and stablecoins must be segregated from the CASP's own assets.\n    - **Complaint Handling:** Establish transparent procedures for handling client complaints.\n3.  **Anti-Money Laundering (AML):** All entities falling under the scope of this policy must strictly comply with Montenegro's existing AML/CFT legislation, applying customer due diligence (CDD) measures to stablecoin transactions as required.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n\n1.  **Voluntary Compliance Demonstration:** Entities are encouraged to voluntarily demonstrate alignment with this interim policy through external audits, legal opinions, or direct dialogue with regulators.\n2.  **Mandatory Reporting:** The quarterly data report to the RMS (as per 5.1) is mandatory for all entities identified by the authorities as falling within the scope of this policy.\n3.  **Enforcement Actions:** Montenegrin authorities retain the right to use existing legal powers (e.g., in consumer protection, anti-fraud, AML, and financial services laws) to investigate and take action against practices deemed to threaten financial stability, market integrity, or consumer welfare. This may include cease-and-desist orders, fines, or referrals for criminal investigation.\n4.  **Transition to Future Law:** All market participants are on notice that this is an interim framework. They are expected to proactively adapt their business models to comply with future Montenegrin crypto-asset legislation.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule\n\n- This interim policy shall be reviewed **12 months** from its effective date, or sooner if significant market developments or international regulatory changes occur.\n- The RMS Working Group will provide recommendations for updates to this policy based on its bi-annual risk assessments.\n- This policy is explicitly temporary and will be **superseded and revoked** upon the entry into force of a dedicated Montenegrin Law on Crypto-Assets or equivalent comprehensive regulation.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements\n\nThis interim policy is formulated with reference to the following regulatory frameworks and principles:\n\n1.  **Primary Benchmark:**\n    - Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 on Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) – Particularly Title III (Asset-Referenced Tokens) and Title IV (E-Money Tokens).\n2.  **Montenegrin Legal Context:**\n    - Law on the Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing.\n    - Consumer Protection Law.\n    - Financial Services Legislation (general principles).\n    - Montenegro's strategic commitment to EU accession and regulatory alignment.\n3.  **International Standards:**\n    - Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Recommendations on Virtual Assets and VASPs.\n    - International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) recommendations for crypto-asset markets.\n    - Financial Stability Board (FSB) recommendations for the regulation of global stablecoin arrangements.\n\n---\n*Disclaimer: This document is an interim policy statement and does not constitute formal, binding legislation. It outlines regulatory expectations and a monitoring framework pending the adoption of formal law. Legal advice should be sought for specific operational guidance.*\n```"

Policy Title\nInterim Regulatory Monitoring and Policy Framework for Stablecoin Activities in Montenegro\n\n## 2. Purpose and Scope\n\n### 2.1 Purpose\nThis policy establishes an immediate regulatory monitoring system and interim legal framework for the issuance, offering, trading, and custody of stablecoins within Montenegro. The purpose is to:\n- Provide legal certainty and consumer protection in the absence of specific national legislation.\n- Mitigate financial stability risks, market integrity risks, and money laundering risks associated with stablecoin activities.\n- Align Montenegro's regulatory approach with evolving international standards, using the European Union's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) as a primary benchmark.\n- Create a structured process for monitoring the stablecoin market and developing permanent national regulations.\n\n### 2.2 Scope\nThis policy applies to:\n- All natural and legal persons issuing, offering to the public, or seeking admission to trading of stablecoins within Montenegro.\n- All crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) involved in the trading, exchange, custody, or administration of stablecoins for clients in Montenegro.\n- Credit institutions and other financial entities engaging in stablecoin-related activities.\n- The relevant Montenegrin regulatory and supervisory authorities tasked with monitoring this sector.\n\n*Note:* This interim framework covers all types of stablecoins, with particular emphasis on significant asset-referenced tokens (ARTs) and e-money tokens (EMTs) as defined in the benchmark framework.\n\n## 3. Definitions\n\n- **Stablecoin:** A type of crypto-asset that purports to maintain a stable value by referencing to the value of one or several fiat currencies, commodities, crypto-assets, or a combination thereof.\n- **Asset-Referenced Token (ART):** A type of stablecoin that is not an e-money token and purports to maintain a stable value by referencing to any other value or right, including one or several official currencies.\n- **E-Money Token (EMT):** A type of stablecoin that purports to maintain a stable value by referencing the value of one official currency.\n- **Crypto-Asset Service Provider (CASP):** Any person whose occupation or business is the provision of one or more crypto-asset services to third parties on a professional basis.\n- **Issuer:** A legal person who offers to the public or seeks admission to trading of a stablecoin.\n- **MiCA:** Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 May 2023 on Markets in Crypto-Assets.\n- **Regulatory Monitoring System:** The structured process of data collection, risk assessment, and market surveillance implemented by Montenegrin authorities to oversee stablecoin activities.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\n\nThe Government of Montenegro, through its competent authorities, hereby establishes an interim regulatory posture for stablecoins. Until a comprehensive national law on crypto-assets is enacted, all stablecoin-related activities within Montenegrin jurisdiction shall be conducted with reference to the principles and key requirements of the EU's MiCA regulation.\n\nThis is not a direct transposition of MiCA but a principled adoption of its core regulatory objectives: consumer and investor protection, market integrity, financial stability, and the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing. All market participants are expected to adhere to the spirit and key operational requirements of this benchmark framework. The authorities will monitor compliance and may take supervisory action against activities that pose significant risk, even in the absence of specific national rules.\n\n## 5. Procedures\n\n### 5.1 Establishment of the Regulatory Monitoring System (RMS)\n1.  **Lead Authority:** The Ministry of Finance, in collaboration with the Central Bank of Montenegro (if applicable) and the relevant financial supervisory authority, shall establish an inter-agency RMS Working Group.\n2.  **Data Collection:** The RMS will implement a quarterly reporting requirement for all known stablecoin issuers and CASPs operating in Montenegro. Reports must include:\n    - Nature and volume of activities.\n    - Reserve asset composition and audit reports (for issuers).\n    - Consumer complaint statistics.\n        - Operational risk assessments.\n3.  **Market Surveillance:** Authorities will actively monitor public offers, marketing communications, and trading platforms for misleading claims, market abuse, or fraudulent activity related to stablecoins.\n4.  **Risk Assessment:** The RMS Working Group will produce a bi-annual risk assessment report on the stablecoin ecosystem in Montenegro, identifying emerging vulnerabilities and informing the development of permanent legislation.\n\n### 5.2 Interim Regulatory Expectations for Market Participants\n1.  **For Stablecoin Issuers:**\n    - **Authorization Expectation:** Entities planning to issue significant stablecoins are strongly advised to engage in pre-issuance consultations with the Montenegrin authorities and demonstrate how they meet key MiCA-like requirements (e.g., governance, reserve management, redemption rights, whitepaper disclosures).\n    - **Transparency:** All issuers must publish detailed, clear, and non-misleading whitepapers or equivalent disclosure documents for their stablecoin.\n    - **Reserve Management:** Issuers of fiat-referenced stablecoins must hold reserve assets in secure, segregated accounts, with a 1:1 backing principle, and subject to regular independent audit.\n2.  **For Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs):**\n    - **Conduct of Business:** CASPs must act honestly, fairly, and professionally in the best interests of their clients. Clear information on risks, costs, and terms of service must be provided.\n    - **Safeguarding of Client Assets:** Client funds and stablecoins must be segregated from the CASP's own assets.\n    - **Complaint Handling:** Establish transparent procedures for handling client complaints.\n3.  **Anti-Money Laundering (AML):** All entities falling under the scope of this policy must strictly comply with Montenegro's existing AML/CFT legislation, applying customer due diligence (CDD) measures to stablecoin transactions as required.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n\n1.  **Voluntary Compliance Demonstration:** Entities are encouraged to voluntarily demonstrate alignment with this interim policy through external audits, legal opinions, or direct dialogue with regulators.\n2.  **Mandatory Reporting:** The quarterly data report to the RMS (as per 5.1) is mandatory for all entities identified by the authorities as falling within the scope of this policy.\n3.  **Enforcement Actions:** Montenegrin authorities retain the right to use existing legal powers (e.g., in consumer protection, anti-fraud, AML, and financial services laws) to investigate and take action against practices deemed to threaten financial stability, market integrity, or consumer welfare. This may include cease-and-desist orders, fines, or referrals for criminal investigation.\n4.  **Transition to Future Law:** All market participants are on notice that this is an interim framework. They are expected to proactively adapt their business models to comply with future Montenegrin crypto-asset legislation.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule\n\n- This interim policy shall be reviewed **12 months** from its effective date, or sooner if significant market developments or international regulatory changes occur.\n- The RMS Working Group will provide recommendations for updates to this policy based on its bi-annual risk assessments.\n- This policy is explicitly temporary and will be **superseded and revoked** upon the entry into force of a dedicated Montenegrin Law on Crypto-Assets or equivalent comprehensive regulation.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements\n\nThis interim policy is formulated with reference to the following regulatory frameworks and principles:\n\n1.  **Primary Benchmark:**\n    - Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 on Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) – Particularly Title III (Asset-Referenced Tokens) and Title IV (E-Money Tokens).\n2.  **Montenegrin Legal Context:**\n    - Law on the Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing.\n    - Consumer Protection Law.\n    - Financial Services Legislation (general principles).\n    - Montenegro's strategic commitment to EU accession and regulatory alignment.\n3.  **International Standards:**\n    - Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Recommendations on Virtual Assets and VASPs.\n    - International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) recommendations for crypto-asset markets.\n    - Financial Stability Board (FSB) recommendations for the regulation of global stablecoin arrangements.\n\n---\n*Disclaimer: This document is an interim policy statement and does not constitute formal, binding legislation. It outlines regulatory expectations and a monitoring framework pending the adoption of formal law. Legal advice should be sought for specific operational guidance.*\n```"

All fundamental regulatory requirements are unmet, creating extreme legal, operational, and reputational risks.
