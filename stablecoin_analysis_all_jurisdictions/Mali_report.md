# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-06T00:52:46.711019

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no policies addressing stablecoin regulation in Mali, representing a complete regulatory vacuum. All fundamental regulatory requirements for stablecoin issuance and operation are unmet. Immediate action is required to prevent severe regulatory consequences, including potential business shutdown, substantial fines, and criminal liability. The company must prioritize establishing basic regulatory compliance before any operational activities commence. Given the limited research results obtained, urgent engagement with local legal counsel in Mali is essential to obtain accurate regulatory requirements and develop appropriate compliance frameworks.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Legal authorization to issue stablecoins (likely requiring licensing from Central Bank of Mali or regional banking authority)

**Current Status:** No policy exists regarding licensing requirements for stablecoin issuance

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing the fundamental legal requirement to obtain proper authorization before issuing stablecoins in Mali

**Impact:** Potential for immediate regulatory enforcement action, fines, business shutdown, and criminal liability for operating without proper authorization

**Recommendation:** 1. Conduct comprehensive legal research on Mali's financial regulations 2. Engage local legal counsel to determine licensing requirements 3. Develop licensing application strategy 4. Create policy framework for regulatory engagement

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Reserve requirements and asset backing for stablecoins (likely requiring 1:1 backing with safe, liquid assets)

**Current Status:** No policies exist regarding reserve management, custody, or asset backing

**Gap:** No framework for maintaining adequate reserves, custody arrangements, or asset verification processes

**Impact:** Risk of insolvency, loss of customer funds, regulatory sanctions, and loss of market confidence in the stablecoin

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop comprehensive reserve management policy 2. Establish custody arrangements with regulated institutions 3. Implement regular third-party audits 4. Create transparent reporting mechanisms

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance (required under West African regional standards and FATF recommendations)

**Current Status:** No AML/CFT policies exist

**Gap:** Complete absence of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls, customer due diligence, or transaction monitoring

**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, potential criminal liability, loss of banking relationships, and reputational damage

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop comprehensive AML/CFT program 2. Implement KYC/CDD procedures 3. Establish transaction monitoring system 4. Designate AML compliance officer 5. Create suspicious activity reporting procedures

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop clear terms of service and disclosures 2. Create complaint resolution process 3. Establish customer fund protection mechanisms 4. Implement risk disclosure framework

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Cybersecurity and operational resilience standards

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop comprehensive cybersecurity policy 2. Implement security controls and monitoring 3. Create incident response plan 4. Establish business continuity framework

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Reporting and supervisory requirements to regulatory authorities

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop regulatory reporting framework 2. Create supervisory engagement policy 3. Establish compliance monitoring program 4. Designate regulatory liaison officer
