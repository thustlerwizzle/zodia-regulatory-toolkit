# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-06T00:12:12.808629

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE FAILURE: The company appears to have no policies addressing stablecoin operations in Libya, which represents an extreme compliance risk. Libya's regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is likely restrictive or prohibitive given the country's political situation and traditional financial controls. All identified regulatory requirements are completely unmet. Immediate cessation of any Libyan operations is recommended until proper regulatory analysis can be conducted and a comprehensive compliance framework established. The priority must be to understand the actual regulatory landscape through local legal counsel before developing any policies or continuing operations.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Legal framework for stablecoin issuance and operation in Libya

**Current Status:** No documented policies found

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing stablecoin operations in Libya. No framework exists for compliance with potential Libyan financial regulations, which likely prohibit or strictly regulate cryptocurrency activities given the country's political and economic situation.

**Impact:** Operating without any regulatory compliance framework exposes the company to severe legal penalties, asset seizure, potential criminal liability for executives, and complete business shutdown in Libya.

**Recommendation:** Immediately suspend all stablecoin operations in Libya until proper regulatory analysis can be conducted. Engage local legal counsel to determine the actual regulatory landscape. Develop a comprehensive compliance framework before considering any operations.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance specific to Libya

**Current Status:** No Libya-specific AML/CTF policies

**Gap:** Libya is a high-risk jurisdiction with significant AML/CTF concerns. No policies address enhanced due diligence, sanctions screening, or transaction monitoring requirements specific to Libyan operations or customers.

**Impact:** High risk of facilitating money laundering or terrorist financing, leading to severe international sanctions, reputational damage, and potential criminal prosecution under Libyan and international laws.

**Recommendation:** Implement enhanced due diligence procedures for any Libyan operations, including comprehensive sanctions screening against Libyan and international lists. Establish transaction monitoring with lower thresholds and stricter reporting requirements.

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Central Bank of Libya authorization for digital currency operations

**Current Status:** No authorization obtained or policy for obtaining it

**Gap:** No evidence of engagement with or authorization from the Central Bank of Libya, which likely maintains strict control over currency and financial operations. No policy exists for obtaining necessary banking or financial services licenses.

**Impact:** Operating without central bank authorization constitutes illegal financial activity, potentially leading to criminal charges, asset forfeiture, and permanent exclusion from the Libyan market.

**Recommendation:** Cease all operations until proper authorization can be sought. Develop a licensing strategy and engagement plan with the Central Bank of Libya and other relevant authorities.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive consumer protection policies including Arabic-language disclosures, Libyan-law-compliant terms of service, and appropriate reserve requirements. Establish a local dispute resolution mechanism.

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Data privacy and localization requirements

**Recommendation:** Conduct a data protection impact assessment for Libyan operations. Implement data localization if required and develop policies for handling government data requests in compliance with Libyan law.
