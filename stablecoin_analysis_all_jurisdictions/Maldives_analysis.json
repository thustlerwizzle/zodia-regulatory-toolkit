It is strictly prohibited for any personnel to engage in, facilitate, or support any transaction or business relationship that violates sanctions laws or involves prohibited jurisdictions, entities, or individuals.\n\nThe organization will implement a risk-based approach to cross-border compliance, which includes mandatory sanctions screening for all relevant parties and a formal assessment of jurisdictional risks prior to entering new markets or initiating significant transactions.\n\n## 5. Procedures\n\n### 5.1 Sanctions Screening Procedure\n1.  **Automated Screening:** All new customers, vendors, counterparties, and beneficiaries must be screened against the current consolidated global sanctions list prior to onboarding and on an ongoing, periodic basis thereafter. All transactional data (e.g., wire transfer details) must be screened in real-time prior to execution.\n2.  **Screening Tools:** Screening will be performed using the approved compliance software [Name of Software/Tool]. The Compliance Department is responsible for maintaining and updating the sanctions lists within the tool.\n3.  **Match Review:** Any potential match or \"hit\" generated by the automated system must be escalated immediately to the Compliance Officer. The Compliance Officer will conduct a manual review to determine if it is a true match or a false positive.\n4.  **True Match Action:** If a true match is confirmed, the transaction must be blocked or rejected, and the relationship must not proceed. A report must be filed as required by relevant regulatory bodies (e.g., OFAC report).

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Maldives\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-02-06T00:47:50.231349\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company currently has no established policies for stablecoin operations, representing a critical compliance gap. Given the absence of specific regulatory research results for Maldives, this analysis is based on international regulatory standards and emerging global stablecoin frameworks. All identified regulatory requirements are currently not met, requiring immediate attention to foundational policy development. Priority should be given to establishing legal compliance, AML/CTF frameworks, and reserve management policies before any stablecoin operations commence. Engagement with the Maldives Monetary Authority is recommended to clarify specific national requirements.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Legal framework for stablecoin issuance and operation in Maldives\n\n**Current Status:** No specific stablecoin policy identified\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing stablecoin operations, including issuance, redemption, reserve management, and consumer protection\n\n**Impact:** Legal and operational risks including potential regulatory sanctions, inability to operate legally, and loss of customer trust\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive stablecoin policy framework aligned with international standards (FSB, BIS) and engage with Maldives Monetary Authority for regulatory clarity\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) requirements for digital assets\n\n**Current Status:** No specific AML/CTF policies for stablecoin transactions\n\n**Gap:** Lack of customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting procedures specific to stablecoin operations\n\n**Impact:** High risk of regulatory enforcement actions, financial penalties, and reputational damage\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement FATF Travel Rule compliance, establish customer identification procedures, and develop transaction monitoring systems for stablecoin flows\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Reserve management and transparency requirements\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish reserve management policy with 1:1 backing, regular third-party audits, and public attestation reports\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop clear terms of service, redemption policies, and establish consumer complaint resolution process\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive operational risk framework including smart contract audits, multi-signature controls, and incident response plans\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **stablecoin_legal_framework**: not_met\n❌ **aml_ctf_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **reserve_management**: not_met\n❌ **consumer_protection**: not_met\n❌ **operational_risk_management**: not_met\n❌ **cross-border_compliance**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update Summary\nGenerated: 2026-02-06T00:48:19.377426\n\n## Overview\nThis document summarizes proposed updates to company policies and standards based on regulatory gap analysis.\n\n## New Policies Required\n\n## Modified Policies\n\n### GAP-001\n**Category:** Legal\n**Current Policy:** No specific stablecoin policy identified\n**Proposed Change:** Develop comprehensive stablecoin policy framework aligned with international standards (FSB, BIS) and engage with Maldives Monetary Authority for regulatory clarity\n\n### GAP-002\n**Category:** AML/KYC\n**Current Policy:** No specific AML/CTF policies for stablecoin transactions\n**Proposed Change:** Implement FATF Travel Rule compliance, establish customer identification procedures, and develop transaction monitoring systems for stablecoin flows\n\n### GAP-003\n**Category:** Risk Management\n**Current Policy:** No reserve management policy\n**Proposed Change:** Establish reserve management policy with 1:1 backing, regular third-party audits, and public attestation reports\n\n### GAP-004\n**Category:** Data Protection\n**Current Policy:** No consumer protection framework for stablecoin users\n**Proposed Change:** Develop clear terms of service, redemption policies, and establish consumer complaint resolution process\n\n### GAP-005\n**Category:** Risk Management\n**Current Policy:** No specific operational risk policies for stablecoin infrastructure\n**Proposed Change:** Implement comprehensive operational risk framework including smart contract audits, multi-signature controls, and incident response plans\n\n### GAP-006\n**Category:** Compliance\n**Current Policy:** No cross-border compliance framework\n**Proposed Change:** Establish sanctions screening procedures and jurisdictional risk assessment framework\n\n\n\n## Policy Implementation\n\n✅ **Automatically implemented 6 policies**\n\n📁 **Saved to:** C:\\Users\\takun\\Desktop\\Regulatory_Policies\n\n📄 **Summary file:** C:\\Users\\takun\\Desktop\\Regulatory_Policies\\IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md\n\n\n### Implemented Policies:\n\n- **GAP-001** (Legal) - Legal_GAP-001.md\n\n- **GAP-002** (AML/KYC) - AML_KYC_GAP-002.md\n\n- **GAP-003** (Risk Management) - Risk Management_GAP-003.md\n\n- **GAP-004** (Data Protection) - Data Protection_GAP-004.md\n\n- **GAP-005** (Risk Management) - Risk Management_GAP-005.md\n\n- **GAP-006** (Compliance) - Compliance_GAP-006.md\n\n\n"
