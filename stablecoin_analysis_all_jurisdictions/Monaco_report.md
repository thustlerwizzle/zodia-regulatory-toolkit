# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-06T03:37:48.100587

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company appears to have no documented policies addressing stablecoin regulatory requirements in Monaco. All fundamental regulatory requirements are unmet, creating severe legal, operational, and reputational risks. Immediate action is required to: 1) Engage with Monegasque regulators (CCAF) to understand licensing requirements, 2) Develop comprehensive compliance program aligned with EU MiCA regulation, and 3) Implement AML/CFT framework. The company should suspend any stablecoin operations until basic regulatory requirements are addressed to avoid severe enforcement actions.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance requires authorization/license from Monegasque authorities (Monaco does not have a central bank; financial regulation falls under French/EU frameworks and Commission de Contrôle des Activités Financières - CCAF)

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** Complete absence of licensing/authorization framework for stablecoin operations in Monaco

**Impact:** Operating without authorization could result in regulatory enforcement, fines, business suspension, and reputational damage

**Recommendation:** 1. Engage with CCAF to understand authorization requirements 2. Develop licensing application framework 3. Create policy for ongoing regulatory reporting

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Compliance with EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) which Monaco must align with as part of monetary agreement with France

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** No policies addressing MiCA requirements for stablecoin issuers including capital requirements, reserve management, and consumer protection

**Impact:** Non-compliance with MiCA could lead to EU-wide enforcement actions, significant fines (up to 5-10% of annual turnover), and market access restrictions

**Recommendation:** 1. Conduct MiCA gap analysis 2. Develop comprehensive compliance program covering Articles 16-35 of MiCA 3. Implement reserve management and redemption policies

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance under Monaco's Law No. 1.362 and alignment with EU AML Directives

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** No AML/CFT framework specific to stablecoin operations including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting

**Impact:** Exposure to money laundering risks, regulatory sanctions, loss of banking relationships, and potential criminal liability

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop risk-based AML/CFT program 2. Implement customer identification and verification procedures 3. Establish transaction monitoring system 4. Designate AML compliance officer

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection requirements including clear disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop consumer disclosure documents 2. Create redemption policy and procedures 3. Establish complaint handling mechanism 4. Implement terms of service addressing consumer rights

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Reserve management and audit requirements for asset-backed stablecoins

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop reserve management policy 2. Establish custody arrangements 3. Implement regular independent audits 4. Create public reporting framework for reserve status

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity requirements

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop comprehensive cybersecurity policy 2. Implement incident response plan 3. Establish business continuity framework 4. Conduct regular security assessments
