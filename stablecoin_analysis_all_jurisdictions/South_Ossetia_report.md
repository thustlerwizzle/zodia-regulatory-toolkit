## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no policies addressing stablecoin operations in South Ossetia, representing a complete regulatory vacuum. All major regulatory domains show 'not_met' status. Immediate action is required to suspend operations and conduct comprehensive regulatory research before developing jurisdiction-specific policies. The situation presents severe legal, financial, and reputational risks that could threaten the company's viability if not addressed urgently. Priority should be given to understanding South Ossetia's legal recognition of stablecoins and establishing basic AML/CFT compliance before any operational activities resume.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Legal recognition and regulatory framework for stablecoin operations in South Ossetia

**Current Status:** No specific policies addressing South Ossetian jurisdiction

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing the legal status, licensing requirements, or operational permissions for stablecoin activities in South Ossetia

**Impact:** Potential for illegal operations, regulatory enforcement actions, asset seizure, and criminal liability for operating without proper authorization

**Recommendation:** Immediately suspend all stablecoin operations involving South Ossetia until legal research confirms regulatory framework. Engage local legal counsel to research South Ossetian financial regulations and obtain necessary licenses before resuming operations.

### Gap 2: GAP-002

**Recommendation:** Develop jurisdiction-specific AML/CFT procedures for South Ossetia including: 1) Enhanced due diligence requirements, 2) Specific reporting requirements to South Ossetian authorities, 3) Sanctions screening against South Ossetian lists, 4) Transaction monitoring thresholds specific to local regulations.

## High Priority Gaps

**Requirement:** Consumer protection requirements for stablecoin users in South Ossetia

**Recommendation:** Create South Ossetia-specific consumer protection policies including: 1) Clear disclosure of risks in local language, 2) Redemption procedures compliant with local law, 3) Reserve audit requirements, 4) Local dispute resolution mechanisms, 5) User fund segregation requirements.

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Data privacy and localization requirements in South Ossetia

**Recommendation:** Conduct data protection impact assessment for South Ossetian operations. Implement data localization requirements if mandated. Develop privacy notices and consent mechanisms compliant with local laws. Establish data breach notification procedures for South Ossetian authorities.

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Tax compliance and reporting obligations in South Ossetia

**Recommendation:** Engage local tax advisors to understand South Ossetian tax obligations for stablecoin transactions. Implement tax calculation, withholding, and reporting systems. Register with South Ossetian tax authorities and establish regular compliance procedures.
