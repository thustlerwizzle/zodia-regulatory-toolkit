# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-12T17:41:04.178189

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no documented policies addressing stablecoin regulation in the Canary Islands (EU jurisdiction). All fundamental regulatory requirements under MiCA and related EU financial regulations are completely unaddressed. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive compliance framework before any operations commence. The highest priority gaps are reserve requirements, licensing authorization, and AML/CFT compliance, which are prerequisites for legal operation. The company faces existential regulatory risk and cannot operate in its current state without facing severe enforcement actions.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must maintain 1:1 reserves in high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) as per EU's MiCA regulation (applicable in Canary Islands as EU territory)

**Current Status:** No documented policy exists regarding reserve requirements

**Gap:** Complete absence of reserve management framework, custody arrangements, or asset segregation policies

**Impact:** Regulatory enforcement action, license revocation, financial penalties, loss of customer funds, reputational damage

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive reserve management policy including: 1) 100% HQLA backing requirement, 2) daily reserve attestation procedures, 3) independent custody arrangements, 4) monthly public reporting

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must obtain authorization as electronic money institutions (EMI) or credit institutions under MiCA

**Current Status:** No licensing framework or authorization procedures documented

**Gap:** No policy addressing regulatory licensing requirements, application processes, or ongoing authorization conditions

**Impact:** Operating illegally, immediate cease-and-desist orders, criminal liability for directors, inability to operate in EU markets

**Recommendation:** Establish licensing roadmap: 1) Conduct eligibility assessment, 2) Document application requirements, 3) Designate compliance officer, 4) Create pre-authorization compliance program

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance including customer due diligence (CDD), transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting per EU AML Directives

**Current Status:** No AML/CFT policies or procedures documented

**Gap:** Complete absence of KYC procedures, transaction monitoring systems, or reporting mechanisms

**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, criminal prosecution, loss of banking relationships, exclusion from financial system

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive AML program: 1) Risk-based KYC procedures, 2) Transaction monitoring system, 3) Designated MLRO, 4) Regular staff training, 5) Independent audit program

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection requirements including clear disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling per MiCA and EU consumer protection laws

**Recommendation:** Develop consumer protection framework: 1) Clear terms of service, 2) Redemption policy with SLA, 3) Complaint handling procedure, 4) Regular disclosure updates, 5) Customer education materials

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity requirements including incident reporting to authorities

**Recommendation:** Establish operational resilience program: 1) Business continuity plan, 2) Cybersecurity framework (NIST/ISO), 3) Incident response plan, 4) Regular penetration testing, 5) Regulatory reporting procedures

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Governance requirements including fit and proper assessments for management, board oversight, and risk management framework

**Recommendation:** Implement governance framework: 1) Board charter with compliance oversight, 2) Three lines of defense model, 3) Risk management policy, 4) Fit and proper assessments, 5) Regular board reporting
