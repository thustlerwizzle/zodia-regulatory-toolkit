# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-06T03:24:39.611750

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no documented policies addressing stablecoin operations in Micronesia, representing a complete regulatory compliance gap. All fundamental regulatory requirements for stablecoin issuance and operation are unmet. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive regulatory compliance framework before considering any stablecoin activities in Micronesia. The absence of policies creates significant legal, financial, and reputational risks. Priority should be given to establishing legal authorization, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance as foundational requirements.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Legal authorization and licensing for stablecoin issuance and operations in Micronesia

**Current Status:** No documented policy exists regarding stablecoin operations in Micronesia

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing the legal framework for stablecoin activities in Micronesia

**Impact:** Potential for illegal operations, regulatory enforcement actions, fines, and reputational damage

**Recommendation:** Conduct comprehensive legal assessment of Micronesia's financial regulations and establish licensing/authorization policies before any stablecoin operations

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Reserve requirements and asset backing for stablecoins

**Current Status:** No documented reserve management or asset backing policies

**Gap:** Missing policies governing reserve composition, custody, auditing, and redemption mechanisms

**Impact:** Risk of insufficient backing, inability to honor redemptions, and loss of consumer confidence

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive reserve management policy including: 1) Minimum reserve requirements, 2) Permissible asset types, 3) Custody arrangements, 4) Independent auditing procedures, 5) Redemption mechanisms

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance for digital asset transactions

**Current Status:** No specific AML/CFT policies for stablecoin operations

**Gap:** Lack of customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting procedures specific to stablecoins

**Impact:** Violation of financial crime regulations, potential sanctions, and regulatory penalties

**Recommendation:** Implement stablecoin-specific AML/CFT program including: 1) Enhanced customer verification, 2) Transaction monitoring thresholds, 3) Travel rule compliance, 4) Suspicious activity reporting protocols

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements

**Recommendation:** Establish consumer protection framework including: 1) Clear risk disclosures, 2) Terms of service, 3) Complaint resolution process, 4) Educational materials about stablecoin risks

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity

**Recommendation:** Develop operational risk management policy covering: 1) Smart contract security audits, 2) Private key management, 3) System redundancy, 4) Incident response plan, 5) Business continuity planning

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Cross-border transaction compliance

**Recommendation:** Implement cross-border compliance program including: 1) Sanctions screening, 2) Foreign exchange monitoring, 3) Cross-border reporting requirements, 4) Jurisdictional risk assessment
