Policy Title  \nDigital Asset Service Provider (DASP) Licensing and Regulatory Compliance Policy\n\n## 2. Purpose and Scope  \n**Purpose:**  \nThis policy establishes a structured framework for identifying, analyzing, and complying with licensing and authorization requirements for digital asset service providers in jurisdictions where the organization operates or intends to operate. The policy aims to ensure that the organization proactively meets regulatory obligations, mitigates legal and reputational risks, and supports responsible innovation in digital asset services.\n\n**Scope:**  \nThis policy applies to all business units, subsidiaries, and personnel involved in the provision, development, or management of digital asset services, including but not limited to:  \n- Cryptocurrency exchange services  \n- Custody and wallet services  \n- Digital asset transfer and payment services  \n- Issuance, trading, or advising on digital assets  \n- Any other activity qualifying as a regulated digital asset service under applicable law.  \nThe policy covers both existing and prospective service offerings.\n\n## 3. Definitions  \n- **Digital Asset:** A digital representation of value that can be digitally traded or transferred and used for payment or investment purposes, including cryptocurrencies, utility tokens, security tokens, and stablecoins.  \n- **Digital Asset Service Provider (DASP):** Any entity that provides services related to digital assets, including exchange, transfer, custody, administration, or advisory services.  \n- **Licensing Requirement:** A legal mandate requiring formal authorization from a regulatory body to conduct specific digital asset activities.  \n- **Regulatory Research:** The systematic process of identifying, monitoring, and analyzing laws, regulations, guidelines, and supervisory practices applicable to DASP activities.  \n- **Competent Authority:** A government agency or regulatory body with jurisdiction over digital asset services (e.g., financial conduct authorities, central banks, securities regulators).\n\n## 4. Policy Statement  \nIt is the policy of the organization to conduct comprehensive and ongoing regulatory research to identify all applicable licensing and authorization requirements for its digital asset services. The organization will develop and maintain a clear licensing strategy to ensure full compliance with relevant regulations in all operational jurisdictions. No digital asset service shall be offered to the public without prior confirmation that all necessary licenses or authorizations have been obtained, or that an exemption or transitional arrangement is legally applicable and formally approved.\n\n## 5. Procedures  \n\n### 5.1 Regulatory Research Process  \n1. **Jurisdiction Mapping:**  \n   - The Compliance Department, in coordination with Legal, will maintain a register of all current and planned operational jurisdictions.  \n   - For each jurisdiction, an initial assessment will determine whether digital asset services are regulated and which Competent Authorities oversee them.\n\n2. **Requirement Identification:**  \n   - The Compliance Department will conduct detailed research using primary sources (laws, regulations, official guidance) and secondary sources (legal advisories, industry reports).  \n   - Research will identify:  \n     a. Specific activities that trigger licensing.  \n     b. Application procedures, timelines, and costs.  \n     c. Ongoing operational conditions (capital, governance, reporting, AML/CFT, consumer protection).  \n     d. Any grandfathering or transitional regimes.\n\n3. **Gap Analysis:**  \n   - Compare existing operations and controls against identified requirements.  \n   - Document gaps and develop remediation plans with owners and deadlines.\n\n### 5.2 Licensing Strategy Development  \n1. **Strategy Formulation:**  \n   - Based on research, the Compliance and Strategy teams will develop a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction licensing strategy.  \n   - The strategy will address:  \n     a. Prioritization of license applications based on business criticality.  \n     b. Resource allocation (budget, personnel, external advisors).  \n     c. Decision criteria for entering, exiting, or modifying services in a jurisdiction.  \n     d. Engagement plans with regulators and industry bodies.\n\n2. **Executive Approval:**  \n   - The licensing strategy and significant resource commitments require approval by the Chief Compliance Officer and the Executive Committee.\n\n3. **Application Management:**  \n   - A dedicated project plan will be created for each license application, with regular reporting to senior management.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements  \n- All personnel must report planned new services, products, or geographic expansions to the Compliance Department at the earliest concept stage.  \n- The Compliance Department is responsible for maintaining a central register of licenses, applications, and regulatory contacts.  \n- Failure to obtain a required license before launching a service is a serious policy violation and may result in disciplinary action.  \n- Annual compliance certifications must include confirmation of adherence to this policy.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule  \nThis policy shall be reviewed and updated:  \n- **Annually** as part of the compliance program review.  \n- **Ad-hoc** upon the occurrence of any of the following:  \n  a. Changes in regulatory requirements in a key jurisdiction.  \n  b. Introduction of new digital asset services by the organization.  \n  c. Expansion into a new jurisdiction.  \n  d. A material compliance incident related to licensing.  \nThe Chief Compliance Officer is responsible for overseeing the review and approving updates.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements  \n*(Note: This section will be populated with specific references as research is conducted. Examples of common regulatory frameworks are listed below.)*  \n- **Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Recommendations:** Especially Recommendation 15 on virtual assets and VASPs.  \n- **Jurisdiction-Specific Examples (for illustrative purposes):**  \n  - **European Union:** Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA).  \n  - **United Kingdom:** Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (as amended) and FCA Cryptoasset Registration.  \n  - **United States:** State-level money transmitter licenses, FinCEN MSB registration, federal securities laws considerations.  \n  - **Singapore:** Payment Services Act 2019.  \n  - **Japan:** Payment Services Act (as amended).  \n- All subsequent jurisdiction-specific laws, regulations, and official guidance identified through the regulatory research process shall be appended to this policy as an Annex.\n```\n\n*Document Classification: Internal Use Only*  \n*Effective Date: [Date of Approval]*  \n*Policy Owner: Chief Compliance Officer*  \n*Approved By: [Name/Title of Approving Executive]*"

protection policy including clear risk disclosures, redemption mechanisms, and complaint resolution procedures\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Reserve management and transparency requirements\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish reserve management policy with regular attestations, audit requirements, and public disclosure protocols\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-006\n**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive operational risk management framework including cybersecurity standards and incident response plans\n\n##
