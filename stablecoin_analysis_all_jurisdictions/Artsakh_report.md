# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-12T18:26:28.973616

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company lacks any documented policies for stablecoin operations, representing a complete regulatory compliance failure. All fundamental requirements for stablecoin issuance are unmet. The most urgent issue is the jurisdictional uncertainty surrounding Artsakh, which must be resolved before any operations can proceed legally. Immediate action is required to: (1) Determine applicable regulatory regime, (2) Establish basic licensing framework, (3) Implement AML/CFT program, and (4) Create reserve management policies. The company should not engage in any stablecoin-related activities until these critical gaps are addressed to avoid severe legal and financial consequences.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance requires licensing/registration with financial authorities

**Current Status:** No documented policy for stablecoin issuance or regulatory registration

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing stablecoin regulatory licensing requirements

**Impact:** Legal prohibition from operating, severe penalties, criminal liability for executives

**Recommendation:** Establish regulatory licensing framework; determine applicable jurisdiction (Artsakh status unclear - consider Armenian, Russian, or de facto authorities); create registration procedures

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Reserve requirements for stablecoin issuers (typically 100% backing with high-quality liquid assets)

**Current Status:** No reserve management or asset backing policies

**Gap:** No policies governing reserve composition, custody, auditing, or transparency

**Impact:** Insolvency risk, loss of consumer confidence, regulatory enforcement actions, potential fraud allegations

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive reserve policy specifying: asset types (cash, treasuries), custody arrangements, independent auditing, regular reporting, and redemption procedures

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance including KYC, transaction monitoring, and reporting

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT program

**Gap:** Missing entire anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing framework

**Impact:** Severe regulatory sanctions, loss of banking relationships, criminal prosecution, inclusion on international watchlists

**Recommendation:** Implement full AML/CFT program: customer identification, risk assessment, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, staff training, and independent testing

### Gap 4: GAP-007
**Requirement:** Jurisdictional analysis and legal authority determination

**Current Status:** No analysis of Artsakh's regulatory status or applicable laws

**Gap:** Unclear which regulatory regime applies given Artsakh's contested political status

**Impact:** Operating in legal vacuum, potential violation of multiple jurisdictions' laws, international sanctions risk

**Recommendation:** Conduct urgent legal analysis: determine if Armenian law applies, assess Russian influence, evaluate de facto authorities' regulations, consider international sanctions implications

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling

**Recommendation:** Create consumer protection framework: clear terms of service, redemption policy, fee disclosures, complaint procedures, and privacy protections

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational risk management including cybersecurity and business continuity

**Recommendation:** Develop operational risk framework: cybersecurity standards, incident response, business continuity planning, third-party vendor management, and insurance requirements

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Governance and oversight requirements including board accountability and compliance function

**Recommendation:** Establish governance framework: board oversight committee, designated compliance officer, regular compliance reporting, and independent audit committee
