Purpose and Scope\n### 2.1 Purpose\nThe purpose of this policy is to ensure the stability, transparency, and regulatory compliance of all asset-backed stablecoins issued by [Company Name] (\"the Company\"). This policy establishes rigorous standards for the full backing of stablecoin liabilities, the secure custody of reserve assets, and the regular independent verification and public disclosure of reserve holdings. The policy is designed to maintain user confidence, ensure operational resilience, and comply with evolving regulatory expectations for stablecoin issuers.\n\n### 2.2 Scope\nThis policy applies to all stablecoin products issued by the Company that are explicitly designated as \"asset-backed\" or \"stable value\" tokens. It governs all activities related to the management, custody, accounting for, auditing of, and disclosure related to the reserve assets backing these stablecoins. All employees, contractors, and third-party service providers involved in treasury management, finance, compliance, and reporting are required to adhere to this policy.\n\n## 3. Definitions\n*   **Asset-Backed Stablecoin:** A digital currency issued by the Company that is designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified asset or pool of assets, typically a fiat currency (e.g., USD).\n*   **Reserve Assets:** The collective pool of high-quality, permissible assets held in custody to fully back the outstanding supply of asset-backed stablecoins.\n*   **1:1 Backing:** The requirement that the total fair market value of the Reserve Assets, at all times, equals or exceeds the total face value of the outstanding stablecoins in circulation.\n*   **Qualified Custodian:** A regulated financial institution that provides custodial services under applicable state or federal law, and that maintains rigorous standards for asset safekeeping, including segregation of client assets, bankruptcy remoteness, and comprehensive insurance.\n*   **Attestation:** A formal examination and opinion report issued by an independent, licensed third-party accounting firm regarding the adequacy and composition of the Reserve Assets as of a specific date.\n*   **Permissible Assets:** Asset categories pre-approved under this policy for inclusion in the reserve, as detailed in Section 5.1.2.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\n[Company Name] is committed to operating with the highest standards of integrity and transparency.

These reserves shall be held in segregated accounts with Qualified Custodians, entirely separate from the Company's operational funds. The composition and value of these reserves will be subject to regular, independent attestation, and a summary report will be made publicly available on a monthly and quarterly basis.\n\n## 5. Procedures\n### 5.1 Reserve Management\n1.  **1:1 Backing Requirement:**\n    *   The Treasury Department must maintain a real-time (or near real-time) ledger matching stablecoin issuances and redemptions with corresponding deposits to and withdrawals from the Reserve Assets.\n    *   A daily reconciliation process will be performed to confirm that the fair market value of the Reserve Assets meets or exceeds the total outstanding stablecoin liability.\n    *   Any shortfall must be remedied immediately by depositing additional Permissible Assets.\n\n2.  **Permissible Asset Types:**\n    *   **Primary Reserve Assets:** U.S. Dollar deposits held in FDIC-insured accounts or at Qualified Custodians.\n    *   **Short-Term U.S. Treasuries:** U.S. Treasury bills with a remaining maturity of 90 days or less.\n    *   **Other Assets:** Any other asset type (e.g., commercial paper, corporate bonds, other government securities) must receive pre-approval from the Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and will be subject to strict concentration limits, credit quality ratings (minimum A-1/P-1/F1 for short-term, AA- for long-term), and public disclosure requirements. No volatile digital assets (e.g., cryptocurrencies) are permitted.\n\n3.  **Custody Arrangements:**\n    *   All Reserve Assets must be held with one or more Qualified Custodians.\n    *   Custody agreements must legally segregate the Company's reserve assets from the custodian's own assets and from the assets of the Company's other operations.\n    *   The Company must maintain documented due diligence for all custodians and review these relationships annually.\n\n### 5.2 Attestation and Disclosure\n1.  **Independent Attestation:**\n    *   The Company will engage an independent, registered public accounting firm to perform a monthly review and a quarterly examination of the Reserve Assets.\n    *   The monthly review will provide limited assurance, confirming the reserve balance and high-level composition.\n    *   The quarterly examination will provide reasonable assurance, resulting in a formal attestation report (e.g., under SOC 2 or AICPA standards) verifying the 1:1 backing as of the report date and the proper custody of assets.\n\n2.  **Public Disclosure:**\n    *   A detailed Reserve Report will be published on the Company's official website within **15 business days** following the end of each calendar month and quarter.\n    *   The monthly report will include: Total stablecoins outstanding, total value of reserves, and a breakdown of reserve composition by asset category.\n    *   The quarterly report will include all monthly data plus the independent accountant's attestation report and additional detail on specific asset holdings and custodian information, respecting necessary commercial confidentiality.\n\n## 6.

Review and Update Schedule\nThis policy shall be reviewed at least **annually** by the Legal, Compliance, and Finance departments to ensure its continued effectiveness and alignment with:\n*   Operational changes within the Company.\n*   Evolving industry best practices.\n*   Changes in the regulatory landscape, including state and federal stablecoin legislation (e.g., prospective laws like the Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act, Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act, or relevant state regimes like NYDFS's Part 114).\n\nThe policy will be updated as necessary, with all changes approved by the Executive Committee.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements\nThis policy is designed to proactively address current and anticipated regulatory principles for stablecoin issuers, including but not limited to:\n*   **Key Principles:** The 1:1 backing, custody segregation, and audit/ disclosure requirements reflect core tenets outlined by the President's Working Group on Financial Markets (PWG), the Financial Stability Board (FSB), and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO).\n*   **State Regulations:** The policy aligns with frameworks such as the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) \"Guidance on the Issuance of U.S. Dollar-Backed Stablecoins\" (Part 114), which mandates redeemability, reserve requirements, and independent attestation.\n*   **Federal Guidance:** It anticipates potential federal legislation requiring clear reserve asset rules, custody standards, and transparency obligations for payment stablecoin issuers.\n*   **Financial Accounting:** Reserve accounting and attestation procedures will follow relevant U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and standards set by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).\n```"

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Cambodia\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-01-30T20:06:07.624800\n\n## Executive Summary\nOverall compliance status is severely deficient. The company lacks any foundational policies required to operate a stablecoin or similar payment/financial service in Cambodia legally and safely. The regulatory environment for stablecoins in Cambodia is nascent but governed by existing broad financial laws. All identified gaps are at least 'High' priority, with the absence of licensing and AML/CFT frameworks being 'Critical'. Immediate action is required to develop a full suite of policies and engage with Cambodian regulators before any operational activity commences. The company is currently non-compliant and exposed to extreme legal, financial, and reputational risks.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Legal authorization/licensing for stablecoin issuance or operation in Cambodia\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found\n\n**Gap:** Company lacks any policy addressing the fundamental requirement for legal authorization to operate stablecoin services in Cambodia. The National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) has not issued a specific regulatory framework for stablecoins, but general financial and payment system laws apply. Operating without clarity on authorization constitutes a significant legal risk.\n\n**Impact:** Risk of regulatory enforcement action, including cease-and-desist orders, fines, and reputational damage. Potential criminal liability for operating an unauthorized payment service.\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Immediately engage legal counsel in Cambodia to interpret the applicability of the Law on Banking and Financial Institutions, the Law on Payment Services, and NBC regulations to the proposed stablecoin activity. 2. Develop a policy that mandates obtaining formal regulatory approval or a license before any operational launch. 3. Establish a procedure for ongoing regulatory dialogue with the NBC.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Adherence to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (CFT) regulations as per Cambodia's AML/CFT Law and NBC guidelines.\n\n**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT policy found\n\n**Gap:** Company has no policy to implement mandatory Customer Due Diligence (CDD), Know Your Customer (KYC), transaction monitoring, or suspicious activity reporting required for financial/payment service providers in Cambodia.\n\n**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, loss of ability to transact with correspondent banks, heightened risk of facilitating financial crime, and potential designation as a high-risk entity by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Develop a comprehensive AML/CFT policy aligned with Cambodian law and FATF standards. 2. Implement a risk-based KYC/CDD program. 3. Deploy transaction monitoring and sanctions screening systems. 4. Designate a Compliance Officer and establish a process for reporting to Cambodia's Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU).\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Maintenance of adequate reserves for asset-backed stablecoins (if applicable) and related disclosure/audit requirements.\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Draft a Reserve Management Policy specifying 1:1 backing, permissible asset types, and custody arrangements with qualified custodians. 2. Establish a policy for monthly/quarterly attestations by independent auditors and public disclosure of reserve composition.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures, including clear terms of service, redemption rights, and risk disclosures.\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Create comprehensive Terms of Service and a Privacy Policy compliant with Cambodian law. 2. Develop clear user-facing documentation on redemption processes, fees, and risks. 3. Establish a formal customer complaint resolution procedure.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Cybersecurity and operational resilience requirements for payment systems.\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Develop an Information Security Policy and a Data Protection Policy. 2. Implement a formal Incident Response Plan and Business Continuity Plan. 3. Conduct regular penetration testing and security audits.\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **Legal Authorization & Licensing**: not_met\n❌ **AML/CFT Compliance**: not_met\n❌ **Reserve Management & Transparency**: not_met\n❌ **Consumer Protection**: not_met\n❌ **Cybersecurity & Operational Resilience**: not_met\n❌ **Governance & Risk Management**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update Summary\nGenerated: 2026-01-30T20:06:48.435662\n\n## Overview\nThis document summarizes proposed updates to company policies and standards based on regulatory gap analysis.\n\n## New Policies Required\n\n## Modified Policies\n\n### GAP-001\n**Category:** Legal\n**Current Policy:** No documented policy found\n**Proposed Change:** 1.
