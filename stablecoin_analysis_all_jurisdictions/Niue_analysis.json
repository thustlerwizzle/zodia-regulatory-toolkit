Purpose and Scope\n**2.1 Purpose**\nThis policy establishes the mandatory requirements for the full backing of stablecoins issued within or operating in Niue. Its primary purpose is to ensure the stability, transparency, and consumer protection of the stablecoin ecosystem by mandating robust reserve management, independent verification, and public disclosure.\n\n**2.2 Scope**\nThis policy applies to all entities (\"Issuers\") licensed or authorized to issue fiat-referenced stablecoins (digital assets designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified fiat currency) within the jurisdiction of Niue. It covers all activities related to the establishment, management, custody, auditing, and reporting of reserve assets backing outstanding stablecoin liabilities.\n\n## 3. Definitions\n*   **Issuer:** A legal entity authorized by the Niuean regulatory authority to issue stablecoins.\n*   **Stablecoin:** A digital asset that maintains a stable value relative to a specified fiat currency (e.g., NZD, USD, AUD) and is widely used as a medium of exchange or store of value.\n*   **Reserve Assets:** The high-quality, liquid assets held by the Issuer to fully back the par value of all outstanding stablecoins.\n*   **Outstanding Stablecoin Liability:** The aggregate par value of all stablecoins issued and held by the public.\n*   **Independent Auditor:** A qualified, external audit firm, registered and in good standing with a recognized professional body, with no material relationship to the Issuer that would impair its objectivity.\n*   **Custodian:** A regulated financial institution or qualified custodian responsible for the safekeeping of Reserve Assets.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\nIt is the policy of Niue that all stablecoin Issuers must, at all times, maintain Reserve Assets with a fair market value equal to or exceeding 100% of the par value of all Outstanding Stablecoin Liabilities. These reserves are subject to stringent custody arrangements, must be composed of acceptable asset classes, and must be verified through regular independent audits. Results of these audits must be disclosed to the public to ensure transparency and maintain trust.\n\n## 5. Procedures\n\n**5.1 Reserve Composition & Management**\n*   **5.1.1 Acceptable Reserve Asset Classes:** Reserve Assets must be held in the following forms:\n    *   **a.** Cash and Cash Equivalents: Deposits held in demand or short-term accounts at regulated banks.\n    *   **b.** Short-Term Sovereign Debt:** Debt instruments issued by sovereign nations with high credit ratings (minimum A- from S&P or equivalent), with remaining maturities of three months or less.\n    *   **c.** Niue Government Securities:** Direct obligations of the Government of Niue.\n    *   **d.** Other assets as may be pre-approved in writing by the Niuean regulatory authority, subject to strict liquidity and risk criteria.\n*   **5.1.2 Prohibited Assets:** Reserve Assets shall not include securities issued by the Issuer or its affiliates, other digital assets (cryptocurrencies), illiquid assets, or derivatives for speculative purposes.\n\n**5.2 Custody Arrangements**\n*   **5.2.1 Segregation:** Reserve Assets must be segregated from the Issuer's operating assets and held in separate, bankruptcy-remote accounts.\n*   **5.2.2 Qualified Custodian:** All Reserve Assets must be held with a Qualified Custodian, independent of the Issuer, that is regulated in a jurisdiction with equivalent anti-money laundering and prudential standards.\n*   **5.2.3 Custody Agreement:** A formal custody agreement, outlining the rights, responsibilities, and segregation requirements, must be in place and provided to the regulator upon request.\n\n**5.3 Independent Audit Requirements**\n*   **5.3.1 Frequency:** Issuers must undergo a full-scope independent audit of their Reserve Assets and Outstanding Stablecoin Liability **quarterly**, within 45 days of each calendar quarter-end (March 31, June 30, September 30, December 31).\n*   **5.3.2 Audit Objective:** The audit must provide reasonable assurance that the Reserve Assets' fair market value was equal to or greater than 100% of the Outstanding Stablecoin Liability as of the reporting date.\n*   **5.3.3 Auditor's Report:** The Issuer must obtain a formal Auditor's Report, which must include an opinion on the reserve adequacy and adherence to this policy.\n\n**5.4 Public Disclosure Protocols**\n*   **5.4.1 Report Publication:** A summary of the most recent Auditor's Report, confirming reserve adequacy, must be published on the Issuer's public website within 5 business days of receipt.\n*   **5.4.2 Attestation:** A monthly attestation signed by the Issuer's CEO and CFO, confirming the reserve status as of the last day of the month, must be published on the Issuer's website by the 15th of the following month.\n*   **5.4.3 Content of Disclosure:** Public disclosures must clearly state the total value of Outstanding Stablecoin Liabilities, the total fair market value of Reserve Assets, and a breakdown of Reserve Assets by approved class (e.g., % cash, % government securities).\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n*   Issuers are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal controls to ensure continuous compliance with this policy.\n*   All records related to reserve holdings, transactions, custody, and audits must be maintained for a minimum of seven (7) years and be readily available for inspection by the Niuean regulatory authority.\n*   Any failure to maintain the 100% reserve backing must be reported to the regulator immediately, along with a corrective action plan.\n*   Non-compliance may result in regulatory sanctions, including fines, suspension of operations, or revocation of the Issuer's license.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule\nThis policy shall be reviewed annually by the responsible regulatory body of Niue to ensure it remains effective, aligned with international best practices, and responsive to changes in the stablecoin market and regulatory landscape. Amendments will be made as necessary.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements\nThis policy is established to fulfill the core regulatory requirement that **\"Stablecoin reserves must be fully backed and subject to regular independent audits.\"** It provides the specific framework for implementation within Niue, addressing the previous policy gap. It is designed to be consistent with principles outlined by international standard-setting bodies such as the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) regarding stablecoin arrangements.\n```"

Policy Statement\nIt is the policy of Niue that all stablecoin Issuers must, at all times, maintain Reserve Assets with a fair market value equal to or exceeding 100% of the par value of all Outstanding Stablecoin Liabilities. These reserves are subject to stringent custody arrangements, must be composed of acceptable asset classes, and must be verified through regular independent audits. Results of these audits must be disclosed to the public to ensure transparency and maintain trust.\n\n## 5. Procedures\n\n**5.1 Reserve Composition & Management**\n*   **5.1.1 Acceptable Reserve Asset Classes:** Reserve Assets must be held in the following forms:\n    *   **a.** Cash and Cash Equivalents: Deposits held in demand or short-term accounts at regulated banks.\n    *   **b.** Short-Term Sovereign Debt:** Debt instruments issued by sovereign nations with high credit ratings (minimum A- from S&P or equivalent), with remaining maturities of three months or less.\n    *   **c.** Niue Government Securities:** Direct obligations of the Government of Niue.\n    *   **d.** Other assets as may be pre-approved in writing by the Niuean regulatory authority, subject to strict liquidity and risk criteria.\n*   **5.1.2 Prohibited Assets:** Reserve Assets shall not include securities issued by the Issuer or its affiliates, other digital assets (cryptocurrencies), illiquid assets, or derivatives for speculative purposes.\n\n**5.2 Custody Arrangements**\n*   **5.2.1 Segregation:** Reserve Assets must be segregated from the Issuer's operating assets and held in separate, bankruptcy-remote accounts.\n*   **5.2.2 Qualified Custodian:** All Reserve Assets must be held with a Qualified Custodian, independent of the Issuer, that is regulated in a jurisdiction with equivalent anti-money laundering and prudential standards.\n*   **5.2.3 Custody Agreement:** A formal custody agreement, outlining the rights, responsibilities, and segregation requirements, must be in place and provided to the regulator upon request.\n\n**5.3 Independent Audit Requirements**\n*   **5.3.1 Frequency:** Issuers must undergo a full-scope independent audit of their Reserve Assets and Outstanding Stablecoin Liability **quarterly**, within 45 days of each calendar quarter-end (March 31, June 30, September 30, December 31).\n*   **5.3.2 Audit Objective:** The audit must provide reasonable assurance that the Reserve Assets' fair market value was equal to or greater than 100% of the Outstanding Stablecoin Liability as of the reporting date.\n*   **5.3.3 Auditor's Report:** The Issuer must obtain a formal Auditor's Report, which must include an opinion on the reserve adequacy and adherence to this policy.\n\n**5.4 Public Disclosure Protocols**\n*   **5.4.1 Report Publication:** A summary of the most recent Auditor's Report, confirming reserve adequacy, must be published on the Issuer's public website within 5 business days of receipt.\n*   **5.4.2 Attestation:** A monthly attestation signed by the Issuer's CEO and CFO, confirming the reserve status as of the last day of the month, must be published on the Issuer's website by the 15th of the following month.\n*   **5.4.3 Content of Disclosure:** Public disclosures must clearly state the total value of Outstanding Stablecoin Liabilities, the total fair market value of Reserve Assets, and a breakdown of Reserve Assets by approved class (e.g., % cash, % government securities).\n\n## 6.

Review and Update Schedule\nThis policy shall be reviewed annually by the responsible regulatory body of Niue to ensure it remains effective, aligned with international best practices, and responsive to changes in the stablecoin market and regulatory landscape. Amendments will be made as necessary.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements\nThis policy is established to fulfill the core regulatory requirement that **\"Stablecoin reserves must be fully backed and subject to regular independent audits.\"** It provides the specific framework for implementation within Niue, addressing the previous policy gap. It is designed to be consistent with principles outlined by international standard-setting bodies such as the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) regarding stablecoin arrangements.\n```"

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Niue\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-02-12T13:15:26.813883\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company currently has no documented policies addressing Niue's stablecoin regulatory requirements, resulting in complete non-compliance across all critical regulatory domains. Immediate action is required to develop and implement a comprehensive regulatory compliance framework specific to Niue's jurisdiction. The most critical gaps relate to licensing, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance, which could result in severe regulatory consequences if not addressed promptly. A phased implementation approach is recommended, starting with licensing and reserve policies, followed by AML/CFT and consumer protection frameworks.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance requires licensing/registration with Niue financial authorities\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy for Niue-specific licensing requirements\n\n**Gap:** Company lacks policies addressing Niue's regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers, including licensing procedures, application requirements, and ongoing regulatory reporting obligations\n\n**Impact:** Operating without proper licensing could result in regulatory enforcement actions, fines, business suspension, and reputational damage\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish Niue-specific licensing policy including: 1) Application process for stablecoin issuer license, 2) Capital requirements documentation, 3) Regulatory reporting framework, 4) Compliance officer designation for Niue operations\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin reserves must be fully backed and subject to regular independent audits\n\n**Current Status:** No specific policy addressing Niue's reserve requirements and audit standards\n\n**Gap:** Missing policy requirements for: 1) Composition of reserve assets acceptable under Niue law, 2) Segregation of reserve assets, 3) Frequency and standards for independent audits, 4) Public disclosure of reserve composition\n\n**Impact:** Failure to maintain compliant reserves could lead to regulatory sanctions, loss of consumer confidence, and potential insolvency risks\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop reserve management policy aligned with Niue requirements including: 1) Acceptable reserve asset classes, 2) Custody arrangements, 3) Quarterly independent audit requirements, 4) Public disclosure protocols for reserve status\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance including customer due diligence and transaction monitoring\n\n**Recommendation:** Create Niue-specific AML/CFT policy incorporating: 1) Customer due diligence procedures per Niue standards, 2) Transaction monitoring rules, 3) Suspicious activity reporting to Niue FIU, 4) Record-keeping requirements\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including disclosures and redemption rights\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement consumer protection policy covering: 1) Mandatory disclosures for Niue customers, 2) Redemption process documentation, 3) Complaint resolution procedures, 4) Risk warning requirements\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **licensing_registration**: not_met\n❌ **reserve_requirements**: not_met\n❌ **aml_cft_compliance**: not_met\n❌
