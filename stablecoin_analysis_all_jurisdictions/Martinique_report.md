# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-12T16:44:53.290965

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits complete non-compliance with stablecoin regulatory requirements applicable in Martinique. No policies exist to address the comprehensive regulatory framework under EU MiCA Regulation, AML/CFT directives, consumer protection rules, or data privacy requirements. Immediate action is required to develop a complete regulatory compliance program before any stablecoin operations can commence. The priority should be establishing the foundational authorization requirements under MiCA and implementing AML/CFT controls, followed by consumer protection and operational resilience frameworks. Given Martinique's status as an EU outermost region, all EU financial services regulations apply directly, creating significant regulatory exposure.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance and operation must comply with EU MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) Regulation, which applies to Martinique as an EU outermost region.

**Current Status:** No documented policies for stablecoin operations

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing stablecoin issuance, redemption, reserve management, or governance as required under MiCA.

**Impact:** Legal prohibition of stablecoin operations, potential regulatory enforcement actions, fines, and reputational damage.

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive stablecoin policy framework aligned with MiCA requirements including: authorization process, reserve asset requirements (full backing with high-quality liquid assets), redemption rights, governance, and disclosure obligations.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance under EU AML Directives (5AMLD/6AMLD) and local Martinique regulations requiring KYC, transaction monitoring, and reporting.

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT policies for crypto-asset operations

**Gap:** Missing AML/CFT framework specifically addressing stablecoin transactions, customer due diligence, and suspicious activity reporting.

**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, potential criminal liability, loss of banking relationships, and business shutdown.

**Recommendation:** Implement crypto-specific AML/CFT program including: risk assessment, KYC/CDD procedures for stablecoin users, transaction monitoring systems, and reporting mechanisms to French authorities (TRACFIN).

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Consumer protection requirements including clear disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling procedures.

**Recommendation:** Establish consumer protection framework with: clear terms of service, risk disclosures, redemption policy, complaint handling procedures, and customer education materials.

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity requirements for critical financial infrastructure.

**Recommendation:** Develop operational resilience framework including: cybersecurity standards, incident response plan, business continuity planning, and regular penetration testing.

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Governance and risk management requirements including board oversight, internal controls, and independent audits.

**Recommendation:** Establish governance framework with: board oversight committee, risk management policy, internal control procedures, and requirement for independent annual audits of reserve assets.
