This represents a complete regulatory compliance failure across all essential domains. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive compliance framework before any operations commence. The absence of policies creates severe legal, operational, and reputational risks. Priority should be given to understanding Somaliland's specific regulatory requirements (if any exist) and developing corresponding policies, with particular emphasis on licensing, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance. Given the limited regulatory research results, the company must invest in proper legal and regulatory due diligence specific to Somaliland's jurisdiction."

Policy Title  \n**Interim Policy for the Legal Assessment and Foundational Regulation of Stablecoin Activities in the Republic of Somaliland**\n\n## 2. Purpose and Scope  \n**2.1 Purpose**  \nThis policy establishes the immediate legal and procedural framework for assessing, developing, and implementing regulations governing the issuance, redemption, and operation of stablecoins within the jurisdiction of the Republic of Somaliland. Its primary purpose is to mitigate financial stability risks, protect consumers, prevent illicit finance, and foster responsible innovation in the digital asset space, pending the enactment of formal legislation.\n\n**2.2 Scope**  \nThis policy applies to:  \n- All entities seeking to issue, redeem, manage, or provide services for stablecoins pegged to the Somaliland Shilling (SLSH) or any foreign fiat currency within Somaliland.  \n- Any natural or legal person conducting stablecoin-related activities targeting residents of Somaliland.  \n- Relevant governmental bodies, including but not limited to the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank of Somaliland, and the Financial Intelligence Unit.  \n- This is an interim foundational policy. It does not constitute final legislation but provides the mandatory framework for assessment and initial regulatory operations.\n\n## 3. Definitions  \n- **Stablecoin:** A type of cryptocurrency or digital asset designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified reference asset, typically a fiat currency (e.g., SLSH, USD, EUR) or a basket of such assets.  \n- **Issuer:** A legal entity that creates, issues, and has the obligation to redeem the stablecoin.  \n- **Redemption:** The right of a holder to exchange a stablecoin from the issuer for its underlying reference asset at par value.  \n- **Reserve Assets:** The high-quality, liquid assets held fully backing the outstanding stablecoins in circulation.  \n- **Fiat-Referenced Stablecoin:** A stablecoin that aims to maintain a stable value relative to one or several official fiat currencies.  \n- **Competent Authority:** The designated Somaliland government body with oversight responsibility (initially, a joint task force led by the Central Bank).  \n- **Holder:** A natural or legal person that owns stablecoins.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement  \nThe Government of Somaliland recognizes the potential benefits and risks associated with stablecoins. It is the policy of Somaliland to proactively establish a clear, risk-based legal and regulatory environment for stablecoin activities. This interim policy mandates:  \na) An immediate and comprehensive legal assessment of the existing regulatory landscape.  \nb) The development of a foundational regulatory framework based on principles of financial integrity, consumer protection, market integrity, and financial stability.  \nc) That no entity may commence significant stablecoin issuance or operations targeting the Somaliland market without engaging with the Competent Authority under the procedures outlined herein.  \nd) A commitment to align future formal regulations with international standards, including those from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\n## 5. Procedures  \n**5.1 Phase One: Legal and Landscape Assessment (Months 1-3)**  \n- The Ministry of Finance, in consultation with the Central Bank, shall establish an **Interim Stablecoin Task Force (ISTF)**.  \n- The ISTF will conduct a gap analysis of existing Somaliland laws (Banking, Payments, AML/CFT, Securities, Consumer Protection) against stablecoin activities.  \n- The ISTF will engage with international bodies and review regulatory models from other jurisdictions.  \n- A public consultation notice will be issued to gather input from potential stakeholders, technologists, and the public.\n\n**5.2 Phase Two: Framework Development (Months 4-6)**  \n- Based on the assessment, the ISTF will draft a **Foundational Regulatory Framework Document**. This document will outline core requirements for:  \n  - **Authorization/Licensing:** Criteria for becoming a licensed stablecoin issuer.  \n  - **Reserve Management:** Standards for the composition, custody, segregation, and frequent independent audit of reserve assets.  \n  - **Redemption Rights:** Clear, legally enforceable rules for timely redemption at par.  \n  - **Disclosure & Transparency:** Mandatory public disclosures of reserve assets, governance, and terms of service.  \n  - **Risk Management & Governance:** Requirements for sound governance, operational resilience, and cybersecurity.  \n  - **Interoperability & Technical Standards:** Guidelines for system integrity and compatibility.\n\n**5.3 Phase Three: Engagement & Interim Authorization**  \n- Pending formal law, entities may submit an **Expression of Interest and Preliminary Application** to the ISTF.  \n- The ISTF will review applications against the draft foundational framework on a case-by-case basis and may grant **Provisional Engagement Status**, which is not a license but a pathway to future compliance.  \n- All entities in engagement must adhere to the compliance requirements in Section 6.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements  \nEntities engaging with the ISTF or operating in the market must immediately adhere to the following:  \n- **Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT):** Implement customer due diligence (CDD), transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting as per Somaliland's existing AML law and FATF Recommendations.  \n- **Consumer Disclosure:** Provide clear, accurate, and prominent information on the stablecoin's mechanics, risks, fees, and redemption process.  \n- **Financial Promotions:** Ensure all marketing is fair, clear, and not misleading.  \n- **Data Protection:** Safeguard user data in accordance with principles of privacy and security.  \n- **Prohibition of Misrepresentation:** It is prohibited to claim regulatory approval or endorsement by Somaliland authorities unless explicitly granted in writing by the ISTF.  \n- **Reporting:** Submit monthly volume and user statistics, and report any significant incidents (e.g., security breaches, operational outages) to the ISTF within 24 hours.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule  \n- This interim policy shall be reviewed and updated **quarterly** by the ISTF based on assessment findings, technological developments, and international regulatory evolution.  \n- The foundational framework (Phase Two output) will be formally reviewed **six months** after its publication, with the intent to transition it into a draft bill for parliamentary consideration.  \n- A comprehensive policy review will be triggered by any major stablecoin failure in global markets or a significant shift in international regulatory consensus.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements  \nThis policy and the subsequent framework are developed with reference to, and in anticipation of alignment with, the following standards and requirements:  \n- **Somaliland Constitution** and general principles of contract and commercial law.  \n- **Somaliland Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act** (or equivalent).  \n- **Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Recommendations,** particularly Recommendation 15 on Virtual Assets and VASPs.  \n- **International Monetary Fund (IMF) Policy Papers** on Macro-financial Aspects of Crypto Assets and Global Regulatory Frameworks.  \n- **Bank for International Settlements (BIS)/CPMI** guidance on stablecoin arrangements.  \n- **Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI)** applied to systemic stablecoin arrangements.  \n- **Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision** (where relevant to reserve management).\n\n---\n**Document Custodian:** Interim Stablecoin Task Force (ISTF), c/o Ministry of Finance & Central Bank of Somaliland.  \n**Effective Date:** [Date of Publication]  \n**Status:** Interim Foundational Policy  \n```"

Policy Title  \n**Interim Policy for the Legal Assessment and Foundational Regulation of Stablecoin Activities in the Republic of Somaliland**\n\n## 2. Purpose and Scope  \n**2.1 Purpose**  \nThis policy establishes the immediate legal and procedural framework for assessing, developing, and implementing regulations governing the issuance, redemption, and operation of stablecoins within the jurisdiction of the Republic of Somaliland. Its primary purpose is to mitigate financial stability risks, protect consumers, prevent illicit finance, and foster responsible innovation in the digital asset space, pending the enactment of formal legislation.\n\n**2.2 Scope**  \nThis policy applies to:  \n- All entities seeking to issue, redeem, manage, or provide services for stablecoins pegged to the Somaliland Shilling (SLSH) or any foreign fiat currency within Somaliland.  \n- Any natural or legal person conducting stablecoin-related activities targeting residents of Somaliland.  \n- Relevant governmental bodies, including but not limited to the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank of Somaliland, and the Financial Intelligence Unit.  \n- This is an interim foundational policy. It does not constitute final legislation but provides the mandatory framework for assessment and initial regulatory operations.\n\n## 3. Definitions  \n- **Stablecoin:** A type of cryptocurrency or digital asset designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified reference asset, typically a fiat currency (e.g., SLSH, USD, EUR) or a basket of such assets.  \n- **Issuer:** A legal entity that creates, issues, and has the obligation to redeem the stablecoin.  \n- **Redemption:** The right of a holder to exchange a stablecoin from the issuer for its underlying reference asset at par value.  \n- **Reserve Assets:** The high-quality, liquid assets held fully backing the outstanding stablecoins in circulation.  \n- **Fiat-Referenced Stablecoin:** A stablecoin that aims to maintain a stable value relative to one or several official fiat currencies.  \n- **Competent Authority:** The designated Somaliland government body with oversight responsibility (initially, a joint task force led by the Central Bank).  \n- **Holder:** A natural or legal person that owns stablecoins.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement  \nThe Government of Somaliland recognizes the potential benefits and risks associated with stablecoins. It is the policy of Somaliland to proactively establish a clear, risk-based legal and regulatory environment for stablecoin activities. This interim policy mandates:  \na) An immediate and comprehensive legal assessment of the existing regulatory landscape.  \nb) The development of a foundational regulatory framework based on principles of financial integrity, consumer protection, market integrity, and financial stability.  \nc) That no entity may commence significant stablecoin issuance or operations targeting the Somaliland market without engaging with the Competent Authority under the procedures outlined herein.  \nd) A commitment to align future formal regulations with international standards, including those from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\n## 5. Procedures  \n**5.1 Phase One: Legal and Landscape Assessment (Months 1-3)**  \n- The Ministry of Finance, in consultation with the Central Bank, shall establish an **Interim Stablecoin Task Force (ISTF)**.  \n- The ISTF will conduct a gap analysis of existing Somaliland laws (Banking, Payments, AML/CFT, Securities, Consumer Protection) against stablecoin activities.  \n- The ISTF will engage with international bodies and review regulatory models from other jurisdictions.  \n- A public consultation notice will be issued to gather input from potential stakeholders, technologists, and the public.\n\n**5.2 Phase Two: Framework Development (Months 4-6)**  \n- Based on the assessment, the ISTF will draft a **Foundational Regulatory Framework Document**. This document will outline core requirements for:  \n  - **Authorization/Licensing:** Criteria for becoming a licensed stablecoin issuer.  \n  - **Reserve Management:** Standards for the composition, custody, segregation, and frequent independent audit of reserve assets.  \n  - **Redemption Rights:** Clear, legally enforceable rules for timely redemption at par.  \n  - **Disclosure & Transparency:** Mandatory public disclosures of reserve assets, governance, and terms of service.  \n  - **Risk Management & Governance:** Requirements for sound governance, operational resilience, and cybersecurity.  \n  - **Interoperability & Technical Standards:** Guidelines for system integrity and compatibility.\n\n**5.3 Phase Three: Engagement & Interim Authorization**  \n- Pending formal law, entities may submit an **Expression of Interest and Preliminary Application** to the ISTF.  \n- The ISTF will review applications against the draft foundational framework on a case-by-case basis and may grant **Provisional Engagement Status**, which is not a license but a pathway to future compliance.  \n- All entities in engagement must adhere to the compliance requirements in Section 6.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements  \nEntities engaging with the ISTF or operating in the market must immediately adhere to the following:  \n- **Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT):** Implement customer due diligence (CDD), transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting as per Somaliland's existing AML law and FATF Recommendations.  \n- **Consumer Disclosure:** Provide clear, accurate, and prominent information on the stablecoin's mechanics, risks, fees, and redemption process.  \n- **Financial Promotions:** Ensure all marketing is fair, clear, and not misleading.  \n- **Data Protection:** Safeguard user data in accordance with principles of privacy and security.  \n- **Prohibition of Misrepresentation:** It is prohibited to claim regulatory approval or endorsement by Somaliland authorities unless explicitly granted in writing by the ISTF.  \n- **Reporting:** Submit monthly volume and user statistics, and report any significant incidents (e.g., security breaches, operational outages) to the ISTF within 24 hours.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule  \n- This interim policy shall be reviewed and updated **quarterly** by the ISTF based on assessment findings, technological developments, and international regulatory evolution.  \n- The foundational framework (Phase Two output) will be formally reviewed **six months** after its publication, with the intent to transition it into a draft bill for parliamentary consideration.  \n- A comprehensive policy review will be triggered by any major stablecoin failure in global markets or a significant shift in international regulatory consensus.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements  \nThis policy and the subsequent framework are developed with reference to, and in anticipation of alignment with, the following standards and requirements:  \n- **Somaliland Constitution** and general principles of contract and commercial law.  \n- **Somaliland Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act** (or equivalent).  \n- **Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Recommendations,** particularly Recommendation 15 on Virtual Assets and VASPs.  \n- **International Monetary Fund (IMF) Policy Papers** on Macro-financial Aspects of Crypto Assets and Global Regulatory Frameworks.  \n- **Bank for International Settlements (BIS)/CPMI** guidance on stablecoin arrangements.  \n- **Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI)** applied to systemic stablecoin arrangements.  \n- **Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision** (where relevant to reserve management).\n\n---\n**Document Custodian:** Interim Stablecoin Task Force (ISTF), c/o Ministry of Finance & Central Bank of Somaliland.  \n**Effective Date:** [Date of Publication]  \n**Status:** Interim Foundational Policy  \n```"
