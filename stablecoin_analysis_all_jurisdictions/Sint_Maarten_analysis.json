Purpose and Scope\n### Purpose\nThis policy establishes a comprehensive framework to ensure that all issued stablecoins are fully backed by adequate reserves, managed with appropriate safeguards, and subject to regular independent verification. The policy is designed to ensure operational integrity, protect token holders, and comply with emerging regulatory standards for stablecoin issuers.\n\n### Scope\nThis policy applies to:\n- All stablecoin issuance activities undertaken by the organization\n- All personnel involved in treasury management, reserve custody, financial reporting, and compliance\n- Any third-party custodians, auditors, or service providers engaged in reserve management or attestation\n- All reserve assets held for the purpose of backing outstanding stablecoin liabilities\n\n## 3. Definitions\n- **Stablecoin:** A digital asset issued by the organization designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified reference asset, typically a fiat currency (e.g., USD).\n- **Reserve Assets:** The pool of high-quality, liquid assets held to fully back the value of all stablecoins in circulation.\n- **100% Backing:** The requirement that the aggregate value of Reserve Assets, measured using defined valuation methodologies, equals or exceeds the aggregate face value of all outstanding stablecoins at all times.\n- **Qualified Custodian:** A regulated financial institution that provides safekeeping and administrative services for digital and/or traditional financial assets under appropriate regulatory oversight.\n- **Attestation Report:** A formal examination and opinion issued by an independent third-party auditor regarding the adequacy and composition of reserve assets at a specific point in time.\n- **Authorized Personnel:** Designated employees or officers with explicit authority to manage, transfer, or rebalance reserve assets, as defined in internal access controls.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\nIt is the policy of this organization to maintain, at a minimum, Reserve Assets equal to 100% of the face value of all stablecoins issued and in circulation. Reserve Assets shall be held securely, segregated from operational funds, and valued consistently using transparent methodologies. The composition and adequacy of reserves will be subject to regular, independent audit and public disclosure to ensure trust and regulatory compliance.\n\n## 5. Procedures\n\n### 5.1 Reserve Composition & Eligibility\n- **Permissible Asset Types:** Reserve Assets shall be limited to:\n    - Cash and cash equivalents (e.g., demand deposits with regulated banks).\n    - Short-term government treasury securities (e.g., U.S. Treasury Bills with maturity ≤ 3 months).\n    - Other high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) as may be pre-approved by the Compliance Committee, subject to strict concentration limits.\n- **Prohibited Assets:** The reserve shall not contain corporate debt, equities, cryptocurrencies, algorithmic derivatives, or any illiquid or highly volatile instruments.\n- **Concentration Limits:** No single issuer (excluding sovereign governments for treasury bills) shall represent more than 25% of the total reserve value.\n\n### 5.2 Custody Arrangements\n- All Reserve Assets must be held with one or more Qualified Custodians.\n- Assets must be legally segregated from the custodian's own assets and from the organization's operational assets.\n- Digital access keys for any reserve-related wallets must be managed via multi-signature schemes or institutional-grade custodial solutions with clear separation of duties.\n- A comprehensive inventory of all reserve accounts, including custodian names, account numbers, and asset details, shall be maintained and updated weekly.\n\n### 5.3 Valuation Methodology\n- Reserve Assets shall be valued daily using mark-to-market principles.\n- **Cash & Deposits:** Valued at principal amount.\n- **Government Securities:** Valued using market prices or, if not readily available, using a discounted cash flow model based on prevailing risk-free rates.\n- The total reserve value must be calculated and compared to the total stablecoin liabilities (number of tokens in circulation * 1 unit of reference currency) at the close of each business day.\n\n### 5.4 Rebalancing & Management\n- If the daily valuation shows a reserve shortfall (<100% backing), the Treasury Team must top up the reserve with eligible assets within one (1) business day.\n- Excess reserves (>100% backing) may be rebalanced for efficiency but must never fall below the 100% threshold.\n- All transactions involving reserve assets require authorization from at least two Authorized Personnel.\n\n### 5.5 Independent Third-Party Audit Requirements\n- The organization shall engage an independent, internationally recognized accounting or auditing firm to conduct a reserve attestation.\n- **Frequency:** A full reserve attestation shall be performed at least **quarterly**.\n- **Report Content:** The attestation report must confirm:\n    1. The existence and ownership of the reserve assets.\n    2. The valuation of assets as of the report date.\n    3. That the reserve value meets or exceeds 100% of stablecoins in circulation.\n    4. The segregation and custody of assets.\n- **Public Disclosure:** A summary of the attestation report, including the auditor's opinion and key reserve metrics, shall be published on the organization's website within 30 days of the report's completion.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n- The Chief Financial Officer (CFO) is responsible for the daily implementation of this policy.\n- The Compliance Officer is responsible for monitoring adherence to this policy and regulatory developments.\n- Failure to maintain 100% backing is a **Critical Incident** and must be reported immediately to the Executive Committee and Board, with a corrective action plan enacted without delay.\n- All audit reports, reserve inventories, and transaction logs must be retained for a minimum of seven (7) years.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule\nThis policy shall be reviewed and updated:\n- **Annually** by the Compliance Committee to ensure ongoing relevance and effectiveness.\n- **Immediately** upon the enactment of any new relevant legislation or regulatory guidance.\n- Following any material incident related to reserve management.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements\nThis policy is designed to align with and anticipate regulatory principles as outlined in:\n- Proposed U.S. **Stablecoin Legislation** (e.g., Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act, Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act).\n- **International Standards:** Financial Stability Board (FSB) High-Level Recommendations for the Regulation, Supervision, and Oversight of Global Stablecoin Arrangements.\n- **State-Level Guidance:** New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) Part 114 \"Stablecoins\" requirements for 100% backing and redeemability.\n- **Audit Standards:** Relevant Attestation Standards (e.g., AICPA SOC 2, ISAE 3000) as applied to reserve examinations.\n```"

Review and Update Schedule\nThis policy shall be reviewed and updated:\n- **Annually** by the Compliance Committee to ensure ongoing relevance and effectiveness.\n- **Immediately** upon the enactment of any new relevant legislation or regulatory guidance.\n- Following any material incident related to reserve management.\n\n## 8.

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Sint Maarten\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-02-11T21:20:17.173492\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company exhibits complete non-compliance with Sint Maarten's stablecoin regulatory framework. No policies exist to address fundamental requirements including licensing, reserve management, AML/CFT, consumer protection, or operational risk. This represents an existential regulatory risk that must be addressed immediately before any stablecoin operations commence. The organization requires a comprehensive regulatory compliance program development, starting with engagement with the Central Bank of Sint Maarten to clarify specific requirements, followed by policy development across all identified gap areas. Critical gaps must be addressed before any market entry, with high priority gaps resolved during the licensing application process.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance requires licensing/registration with Central Bank of Sint Maarten (CBSM) under financial institution regulations\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy for stablecoin issuance or regulatory registration\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policy framework for obtaining necessary regulatory approvals to issue stablecoins in Sint Maarten jurisdiction\n\n**Impact:** Potential regulatory enforcement actions, fines, license revocation, and criminal liability for operating without proper authorization\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive licensing strategy and policy framework for CBSM engagement, including application procedures, documentation requirements, and compliance monitoring\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must maintain adequate
