Compliance Requirements\n- **Cover Ratio Maintenance:** Falling below a 1:1 cover ratio is strictly prohibited. Any deficiency must be remedied immediately, and the incident reported to the Board and regulators within 24 hours.\n- **Asset Quality:** Reserve assets must be limited to those meeting the quality and liquidity standards defined in the internal reserve policy.

Review and Update Schedule\nThis policy shall be reviewed and updated:\n- **Annually** by the Compliance Department to ensure ongoing relevance and effectiveness.\n- **Immediately** upon the enactment of any new Abkhazian legislation or regulation affecting stablecoin reserves or custody.\n- Following any material incident of non-compliance or custody failure.\nAll updates require formal approval by the Board of Directors or its designated committee.\n\n## 8.
