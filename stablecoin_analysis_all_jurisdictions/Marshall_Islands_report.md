# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-06T01:04:35.995623

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits a complete absence of documented policies and procedures necessary for stablecoin regulation compliance in the Marshall Islands jurisdiction. All critical regulatory requirements are unmet, representing significant legal, operational, and reputational risks. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive compliance program beginning with licensing strategy, reserve management, and AML/CFT frameworks. The company should engage local legal counsel familiar with MIMA regulations to ensure accurate interpretation of requirements and develop a phased implementation plan addressing critical gaps first.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuer licensing requirement under Marshall Islands Monetary Authority (MIMA) regulations

**Current Status:** No documented licensing policy or application process

**Gap:** Company lacks any policy addressing the need for formal licensing as a stablecoin issuer in the Marshall Islands jurisdiction

**Impact:** Operating without proper licensing could result in regulatory enforcement actions, fines, business suspension, and reputational damage

**Recommendation:** Develop a licensing strategy document outlining the application process, requirements, and timeline for obtaining MIMA approval

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Reserve backing requirements for stablecoins (typically 100% backing with high-quality liquid assets)

**Current Status:** No reserve management policy exists

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies governing reserve composition, custody, auditing, and transparency

**Impact:** Failure to maintain adequate reserves could lead to stablecoin depegging, loss of consumer confidence, and regulatory sanctions

**Recommendation:** Create a comprehensive reserve management policy specifying asset types, custody arrangements, audit frequency, and public disclosure requirements

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting

**Current Status:** No AML/CFT framework documented

**Gap:** Missing entire anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing program required for financial institutions

**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties, potential criminal liability, and exclusion from banking relationships

**Recommendation:** Implement a full AML/CFT program including KYC procedures, transaction monitoring systems, and SAR reporting protocols

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling

**Recommendation:** Develop consumer protection framework with clear terms of service, redemption procedures, and complaint resolution processes

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Cybersecurity and operational resilience requirements

**Recommendation:** Establish comprehensive cybersecurity policy covering access controls, encryption, incident response, and regular security assessments

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Governance and risk management framework

**Recommendation:** Implement a three-lines-of-defense model with clear board oversight, management accountability, and independent compliance function
