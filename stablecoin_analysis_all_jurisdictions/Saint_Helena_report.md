# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-12T13:45:08.227851

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits a complete lack of policies addressing stablecoin regulation in Saint Helena. All fundamental regulatory requirements are unmet, creating significant legal, operational, and reputational risks. Immediate action is required to establish a comprehensive compliance framework, beginning with critical gaps related to legal authorization, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance. Given the absence of specific Saint Helena regulations identified in the research, the company should adopt a conservative approach based on international standards (FSB, FATF) and comparable jurisdictions while engaging directly with Saint Helena authorities to clarify requirements.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Legal authorization to issue stablecoins in Saint Helena jurisdiction

**Current Status:** No policy exists regarding jurisdictional authorization

**Gap:** Company lacks any policy or procedure to determine if stablecoin issuance is legally permitted in Saint Helena or to obtain necessary licenses/registrations

**Impact:** Potential for operating without legal authority, leading to regulatory enforcement, fines, license revocation, and reputational damage

**Recommendation:** Establish a jurisdictional compliance policy requiring legal review and regulatory approval before offering stablecoin services in any jurisdiction

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Reserve requirements and asset backing for stablecoins

**Current Status:** No documented reserve management policy

**Gap:** No policy exists regarding the composition, custody, auditing, or transparency of reserve assets backing stablecoins

**Impact:** Risk of insufficient backing, leading to loss of peg, consumer harm, and regulatory sanctions

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive reserve management policy specifying asset types, custody arrangements, regular audits, and public disclosure requirements

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance for stablecoin transactions

**Current Status:** No specific AML/CFT policy for stablecoin operations

**Gap:** Lack of policy addressing customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting specific to stablecoin activities

**Impact:** Exposure to money laundering and terrorist financing risks, regulatory penalties, and potential criminal liability

**Recommendation:** Implement stablecoin-specific AML/CFT program including KYC procedures, transaction monitoring, and SAR filing protocols

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements

**Recommendation:** Create comprehensive disclosure policy covering all material risks, terms, and conditions of stablecoin offerings

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity

**Recommendation:** Establish operational risk framework addressing cybersecurity, smart contract auditing, disaster recovery, and incident response
