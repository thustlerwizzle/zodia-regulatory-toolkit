## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently exhibits a complete absence of documented policies and procedures required for stablecoin operations in Comoros or any jurisdiction. All fundamental regulatory requirements for financial institutions are unmet, creating severe legal, operational, and reputational risks. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive compliance framework before any operational activities commence. The priority should be addressing authorization requirements, AML/CTF compliance, and reserve management, as these represent existential risks to the business. Given the limited regulatory research available, additional jurisdiction-specific analysis is urgently needed.
