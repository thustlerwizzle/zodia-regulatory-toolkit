# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T21:53:28.604632

## Executive Summary
The company currently has no documented policies addressing stablecoin operations in the Dominican Republic, resulting in complete non-compliance with regulatory requirements. This represents a critical risk exposure that requires immediate attention. The highest priority gaps are in legal framework establishment, licensing, AML/CTF compliance, and operational risk management. A comprehensive regulatory research initiative should be launched immediately, followed by systematic policy development and implementation. Given the absence of current policies, the company should not conduct stablecoin operations in the Dominican Republic until these gaps are addressed to avoid severe legal and financial consequences.

## Critical Priority Gaps

**Requirement:** Legal framework for stablecoin issuance and operation in Dominican Republic

**Current Status:** No documented policies found

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing stablecoin operations in Dominican Republic jurisdiction

**Impact:** Legal exposure, potential regulatory sanctions, inability to operate legally in Dominican Republic

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance

**Recommendation:** Develop AML/CTF policy specific to Dominican Republic requirements, including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and reporting to Unidad de Análisis Financiero (UAF).

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements

**Recommendation:** Create consumer protection policy including clear risk disclosures, terms of service, complaint procedures, and dispute resolution mechanisms compliant with Dominican Republic laws.

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Reserve requirements and asset backing

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive reserve management policy including asset composition requirements, custody arrangements, regular audits, and public reporting.

### Gap 4: GAP-008
