# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-12T17:05:45.203084

## Executive Summary
The company's current policies represent a state of fundamental non-compliance with the regulatory regime governing stablecoins in Saint Barthelemy (French/EU jurisdiction). No foundational policies are in place to address core requirements for authorization, AML/CFT, consumer protection, or prudential safeguards under the EU's MiCA regulation. The compliance status is 'not_met' across all critical domains. Immediate and comprehensive action is required to develop and implement a full suite of compliance policies before any stablecoin operations can be lawfully conducted. The highest priority must be given to ceasing unauthorized activities and establishing the legal and AML foundations.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance and operation require authorization from the Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution (ACPR) under French/EU regulations applicable to Saint Barthelemy as a French overseas collectivity.

**Current Status:** No documented policy for stablecoin operations or regulatory authorization processes.

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing the fundamental requirement for regulatory authorization to issue or operate stablecoins in the jurisdiction.

**Impact:** Operating without authorization could result in immediate enforcement actions, including cease-and-desist orders, significant fines, and potential criminal liability for company officers.

**Recommendation:** Immediately suspend any stablecoin-related activities. Develop and implement a Regulatory Authorization Policy that outlines the process for identifying applicable regulators, preparing authorization applications, and maintaining ongoing compliance with license conditions.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Compliance with EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) which applies to Saint Barthelemy. This includes requirements for stablecoin issuers regarding capital, custody, redemption rights, and governance.

**Current Status:** No policies addressing MiCA compliance.

**Gap:** No framework exists to ensure the company's stablecoin operations meet MiCA's standards for asset-referenced tokens (ARTs) or e-money tokens (EMTs), including reserve management, disclosure, and operational resilience.

**Impact:** Violation of MiCA can lead to fines up to 5-10% of annual turnover, product bans, and reputational damage that would prevent market access across the entire European Union.

**Recommendation:** Conduct a comprehensive MiCA gap assessment. Develop a MiCA Compliance Program covering: 1) Token classification (ART vs. EMT), 2) Reserve management and custody policy, 3) White paper and disclosure requirements, 4) Redemption policy, and 5) Governance and risk management frameworks.

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) compliance under French law and the EU's AML Directives, enforced by the ACPR and TRACFIN.

**Current Status:** No AML/CFT policy documented.

**Gap:** Lack of foundational AML/CFT controls required for a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP), including Customer Due Diligence (CDD), transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and a designated Compliance Officer.

**Impact:** High risk of facilitating financial crime, leading to severe regulatory penalties, loss of banking relationships, and potential criminal prosecution.

**Recommendation:** Implement a full-scale AML/CFT Program. This must include: a written AML Policy, a Risk-Based Approach (RBA) framework, CDD/KYC procedures, transaction monitoring systems, a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) process, and appointment of a qualified AML Compliance Officer. Ensure registration as a VASP if required.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements, including clear, fair, and non-misleading information about the stablecoin's characteristics, risks, and redemption rights.

**Recommendation:** Develop a Consumer Protection and Disclosure Policy. Draft compliant legal terms of service, a MiCA-mandated white paper, and clear, prominent risk disclosures for all user communications and interfaces. Establish a formal user complaint resolution process.

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Prudential requirements, including minimum capital requirements and the segregation and safeguarding of reserve assets.

**Recommendation:** Create a Capital and Reserve Management Policy. Define the composition and valuation of reserves, establish strict custody arrangements with EU-authorized credit institutions or crypto-asset service providers, and implement independent audit procedures for reserve attestations.

## Compliance Status

❌ **Regulatory Authorization**: not_met
❌ **MiCA Compliance**: not_met
❌ **AML/CFT Compliance**: not_met
❌ **Consumer Protection & Disclosure**: not_met
❌ **Prudential Requirements (Capital/Reserves)**: not_met
❌ **Governance & Risk Management**: not_met
