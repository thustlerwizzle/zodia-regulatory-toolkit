All fundamental regulatory requirements for stablecoin issuance and operation are unmet. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive regulatory compliance framework before considering any stablecoin activities in Micronesia. The absence of policies creates significant legal, financial, and reputational risks.

Policy Title  \n**Legal Authorization and Licensing Framework for Stablecoin Issuance and Operations in the Federated States of Micronesia**\n\n## 2. Purpose and Scope  \n**Purpose:**  \nThis policy establishes the legal and regulatory requirements for the issuance, management, and operation of stablecoins within the jurisdiction of the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). Its primary purpose is to ensure that all stablecoin activities are conducted under explicit legal authorization, with appropriate licensing, oversight, and consumer protection safeguards.\n\n**Scope:**  \nThis policy applies to:\n- Any entity seeking to issue a stablecoin pegged to any fiat currency, commodity, or basket of assets within or from the FSM.\n- Any domestic or foreign entity offering stablecoin-related services (including redemption, exchange, wallet, or payment services) to residents of the FSM.\n- Government agencies, financial institutions, and regulatory bodies involved in the oversight of digital assets.\n- The policy covers all stages from pre-licensing assessment to ongoing operations and wind-down procedures.\n\n## 3. Definitions  \n- **Stablecoin:** A type of digital asset designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified reference asset or pool of assets (e.g., the US Dollar, a basket of currencies).\n- **Issuer:** The legal entity that creates, issues, and assumes liability for the redemption of the stablecoin.\n- **FSM Regulatory Authority:** The designated government body (or bodies) responsible for financial regulation, initially the Banking Board and the Office of the Attorney General, as may be further specified by law.\n- **Legal Authorization:** The formal grant of permission by the FSM government, following a statutory and regulatory process, allowing an entity to conduct specific stablecoin activities.\n- **Licensing:** The process by which an applicant receives a formal license, contingent upon meeting prescribed legal, financial, operational, and governance standards.\n- **Reserve Assets:** The high-quality liquid assets held in custody to fully back the outstanding stablecoin supply.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement  \nIt is the policy of the Federated States of Micronesia that **no entity may issue, advertise, sell, or facilitate the exchange of stablecoins within its jurisdiction without first obtaining explicit legal authorization and a license** from the designated FSM Regulatory Authority. The FSM will not permit any stablecoin operations to commence prior to the completion of a comprehensive legal assessment of its existing financial regulatory framework and the establishment of a formal licensing regime. All operations must comply with applicable laws concerning anti-money laundering (AML), countering the financing of terrorism (CFT), consumer protection, financial stability, and data privacy.\n\n## 5. Procedures  \n\n### Phase 1: Legal and Regulatory Assessment\n1.  The Office of the Attorney General, in consultation with the Banking Board and Department of Finance, shall conduct a comprehensive gap analysis.\n2.  This analysis will assess existing FSM statutes (including the Banking Act, Money Transmitter Act, and AML/CFT laws) against the requirements for stablecoin oversight.\n3.  The assessment will produce a report recommending necessary legislative amendments or new legislation to create a clear statutory basis for regulation.\n\n### Phase 2: Framework Development\n1.  Based on the assessment, the FSM Regulatory Authority shall draft and promulgate:\n    - **Licensing Application Guidelines:** Detailing required documents, business plans, governance models, and risk management frameworks.\n    - **Reserve Management Rules:** Standards for the composition, custody, segregation, and independent audit of reserve assets.\n    - **Operational Standards:** Requirements for cybersecurity, redemption protocols, disclosure, and consumer complaint mechanisms.\n2.  A public comment period shall be held for proposed regulations.\n\n### Phase 3: Licensing Application Process\n1.  **Pre-Application Inquiry:** Potential applicants must submit a formal inquiry to the Authority.\n2.  **Formal Application:** Submission of a complete application package as per the published guidelines, including:\n    - Certificate of incorporation/legal existence.\n    - Detailed business plan and whitepaper.\n    - Financial projections and proof of minimum capital.\n    - Reserve management and custody arrangements.\n    - AML/CFT compliance programs.\n    - Fit-and-proper assessments of all directors, officers, and major shareholders.\n3.  **Review & Due Diligence:** The Authority will conduct a thorough review, including background checks and assessment of technical infrastructure.\n4.  **Decision & Licensing:** The Authority will grant, conditionally grant, or deny a license. Licenses are non-transferable and subject to periodic renewal.\n\n### Phase 4: Ongoing Supervision\n1.  Licensed issuers must submit regular reports (monthly, quarterly, annual) on reserve holdings, transaction volumes, and operational integrity.\n2.  The Authority will conduct periodic examinations and audits.\n3.  Licensees must seek prior approval for material changes to business models, reserve policies, or governance.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements  \nAll licensed stablecoin issuers and service providers must:\n- **Maintain 1:1 Reserve Backing:** Hold eligible reserve assets equal to or greater than 100% of outstanding stablecoins at all times.\n- **Ensure Redemption Rights:** Guarantee holders the right to redeem stablecoins for the reference asset at par value under clear and published terms.\n- **Implement Robust AML/CFT Programs:** Adhere to FSM’s AML/CFT laws, including KYC (Know Your Customer), transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting.\n- **Provide Full Disclosure:** Publish clear, audited reports on reserve assets composition and audit results monthly.\n- **Ensure Data Security:** Maintain cybersecurity standards that protect user data and funds.\n- **Segregate Customer Funds:** Keep reserve assets fully segregated from the issuer’s operational funds in bankruptcy-remote structures.\n- **Report Incidents:** Immediately report any security breaches, operational failures, or insolvency risks to the Authority.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule  \n- This policy and its associated regulations shall be reviewed **biennially** (every two years) by the FSM Regulatory Authority.\n- An ad-hoc review may be triggered by significant market events, technological changes, or international regulatory developments.\n- Updates to the policy will follow the same consultative process as initial development, including public comment where appropriate.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements  \nThis policy is designed to align with and implement requirements from the following FSM legal frameworks, pending the specific legislative amendments identified in Phase 1:\n- **FSM Code, Title 29 (Banking)**\n- **FSM Anti-Money Laundering Act**\n- **FSM Regulations on Money Transmitters**\n- **Consumer Protection Principles** under FSM law\n- **International Standards:** Relevant guidance from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), International Monetary Fund (IMF), and Bank for International Settlements (BIS) on stablecoins and digital assets.\n\n---\n\n**Policy Effective Date:** Upon enactment of necessary supporting legislation.  \n**Issuing Authority:** Federated States of Micronesia Regulatory Authority (to be formally designated).  \n**Version:** 1.0\n```"
