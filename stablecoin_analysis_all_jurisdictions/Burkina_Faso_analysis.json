This initiative addresses a critical gap in the current regulatory landscape and ensures a proactive, informed approach to financial innovation and monetary sovereignty.\n\n### 2.2 Scope\nThis policy applies to:\n*   The newly established Legal Framework Analysis Team (the \"Team\").\n*   All relevant ministries, government agencies, and departments of Burkina Faso that will participate in or support the Team's work.\n*   The process of researching and formulating legal and regulatory recommendations pertaining to digital assets, with a primary focus on stablecoins as a medium of exchange and store of value.\n\n## 3. Definitions\n*   **Digital Asset:** A digital representation of value that can be digitally traded or transferred and can be used for payment or investment purposes, including but not limited to virtual currencies, tokens, and stablecoins.\n*   **Stablecoin:** A type of digital asset designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified asset or a pool of assets (e.g., a fiat currency like the CFA Franc, a commodity, or a basket of currencies).\n*   **Legal Framework:** The comprehensive system of laws, regulations, rules, and supervisory guidelines that govern a specific sector or activity.\n*   **BCEAO:** The Central Bank of West African States, the central bank and primary monetary authority for Burkina Faso and other member states of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU).\n*   **Payment System:** A set of instruments, procedures, and rules for the transfer of funds between or among participants.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\nBurkina Faso currently lacks a specific legal and regulatory framework governing the issuance and operation of stablecoins. This absence poses potential risks to financial stability, consumer protection, monetary policy effectiveness, and the integrity of the national payment system. To mitigate these risks and harness potential benefits, it is the policy of the Government of Burkina Faso to immediately constitute a Legal Framework Analysis Team. This Team is mandated to conduct thorough research and produce a foundational analysis and proposed regulatory roadmap, ensuring any future framework is secure, inclusive, and aligned with national interests and regional (WAEMU/BCEAO) obligations.\n\n## 5. Procedures\n### 5.1 Team Formation & Composition\n1.  Within 15 working days of this policy's effective date, a joint directive from the Ministry of Economy, Finance and Foresight and the national authority representing the BCEAO shall formally establish the Team.\n2.

A Chairperson and a Deputy Chairperson shall be appointed to lead the Team.\n\n### 5.2 Mandate and Key Tasks\nThe Team is authorized and required to:\n1.  **Inventory & Analysis:** Conduct a comprehensive review of existing Burkinabè and WAEMU financial laws, regulations, and policies to identify gaps and overlaps concerning digital assets and payment systems.\n2.  **Comparative Research:** Analyze international regulatory models for stablecoins (e.g., EU's MiCA, UK, Singapore, US approaches) and adapt relevant best practices to the regional and national context.\n3.  **Stakeholder Consultation:** Engage with relevant stakeholders including financial institutions, technology providers, academia, and civil society to gather diverse perspectives.\n4.  **Risk Assessment:** Document key risks associated with stablecoin issuance (e.g., reserve management, redemption rights, operational resilience, AML/CFT) and propose mitigation strategies.\n5.  **Draft Foundational Document:** Produce a \"Proposed Legal Framework Analysis Report\" containing:\n    *   A detailed gap analysis.\n    *   Principles for a future regulatory regime.\n    *   Recommendations for legislative, regulatory, or supervisory changes.\n    *   A proposed high-level structure for potential future stablecoin regulation.\n\n### 5.3 Reporting and Timeline\n1.  The Team shall provide a bi-monthly progress report to the approving authority.\n2.  The final \"Proposed Legal Framework Analysis Report\" shall be submitted within **six (6) months** of the Team's first official meeting.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n1.  All assigned members and supporting agencies must prioritize the work of the Team as directed.\n2.  The Team's work must comply with all applicable Burkinabè laws and respect the primacy of the BCEAO in matters of monetary issuance and payment system oversight within the WAEMU.\n3.

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Burkina Faso\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-01-30T19:48:34.595648\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company exhibits a complete absence of policies addressing stablecoin regulation in Burkina Faso, representing critical compliance failure across all regulatory domains. Immediate action is required to establish basic compliance frameworks, with particular urgency around legal authorization, AML/CTF, and consumer protection requirements. The company cannot legally operate in Burkina Faso's jurisdiction without addressing these fundamental gaps. Priority should be given to engaging local legal counsel and regulatory experts to navigate the complex WAEMU regulatory environment while building internal compliance capabilities.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Legal framework for stablecoin issuance and operation in Burkina Faso\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy exists\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing stablecoin operations in Burkina Faso's regulatory environment\n\n**Impact:** Legal exposure, potential regulatory sanctions, inability to operate legally in Burkina Faso\n\n**Recommendation:** Immediately establish a legal framework analysis team to research and document Burkina Faso's financial regulations, with specific focus on digital assets and payment systems\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Licensing requirements for digital asset service providers\n\n**Current Status:** No licensing or authorization policies\n\n**Gap:** No procedures for obtaining necessary licenses or authorizations from Burkina Faso regulatory authorities\n\n**Impact:** Illegal operations, potential criminal liability, asset seizure, and business closure\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop licensing compliance procedures and engage local legal counsel to identify specific licensing requirements from BCEAO (Central Bank of West African States) and national authorities\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance\n\n**Current Status:** No documented AML/CTF policies\n\n**Gap:** Missing AML/CTF framework required for financial service providers in West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) region\n\n**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, reputational damage, potential criminal prosecution, and exclusion from financial systems\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive AML/CTF program including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and staff training aligned with WAEMU directives\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop consumer protection framework including clear risk disclosures, terms of service, complaint procedures, and data protection measures\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Reserve management and transparency for stablecoin issuers\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish reserve management policy with clear custody arrangements, regular independent audits, and public reporting requirements\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-006\n**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive operational risk management framework including cybersecurity protocols, incident response plans, and business continuity procedures\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **legal_framework_analysis**: not_met\n❌
