# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T21:40:27.558767

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no documented policies addressing stablecoin regulation in Djibouti, representing a complete compliance gap across all regulatory domains. This creates severe legal, operational, and reputational risks. Immediate action is required to: 1) Conduct formal regulatory research in Djibouti, 2) Develop foundational compliance policies, and 3) Implement risk mitigation controls. The absence of any policy framework suggests the company may be operating in violation of multiple regulatory requirements, with critical gaps in licensing, AML/CTF, and consumer protection that must be addressed as immediate priorities.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Legal authorization/licensing for stablecoin issuance or operation in Djibouti

**Current Status:** No documented policy addressing Djibouti-specific licensing requirements

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing whether stablecoin operations require specific authorization from Djibouti's Central Bank or Ministry of Finance

**Impact:** Potential for regulatory enforcement actions, fines, or complete prohibition of operations in Djibouti

**Recommendation:** 1. Conduct formal regulatory inquiry with Banque Centrale de Djibouti 2. Develop licensing framework policy 3. Establish compliance monitoring for authorization requirements

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance for digital assets

**Current Status:** No specific AML/CTF policies for stablecoin operations in Djibouti

**Gap:** Lack of policies addressing Djibouti's AML/CTF requirements specific to virtual assets, including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and reporting obligations

**Impact:** Significant legal and reputational risk, potential criminal liability, and exclusion from financial system

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop Djibouti-specific AML/CTF policy aligned with regional standards 2. Implement customer identification procedures 3. Establish suspicious transaction reporting mechanisms

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Reserve requirements and asset backing for stablecoins

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop reserve management policy with clear asset composition rules 2. Implement regular independent audits 3. Establish public disclosure framework

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements

**Recommendation:** 1. Create comprehensive consumer protection policy 2. Develop clear risk disclosure documents 3. Establish consumer complaint resolution process

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Cross-border transaction compliance

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop cross-border transaction compliance policy 2. Implement sanctions screening procedures 3. Establish foreign exchange control monitoring
