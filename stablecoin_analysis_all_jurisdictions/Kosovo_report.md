# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-12T18:44:35.004979

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits a complete absence of policies addressing stablecoin regulation in Kosovo, representing a critical compliance failure. All regulatory requirements are currently unmet, creating severe legal, operational, and reputational risks. Immediate action is required to establish a comprehensive compliance framework before any stablecoin operations can be considered. The priority should be engaging local legal counsel to understand Kosovo's specific regulatory landscape, as stablecoin regulation may be evolving or may fall under existing financial services regulations. The company must develop policies from the ground up, with particular focus on licensing, AML/CFT, and consumer protection requirements.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Legal authorization to issue stablecoins in Kosovo

**Current Status:** No documented policy exists

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing the legal framework for stablecoin issuance or operations in Kosovo

**Impact:** Potential for regulatory enforcement actions, fines, or complete shutdown of operations; legal liability for operating without proper authorization

**Recommendation:** Immediately conduct comprehensive legal research on Kosovo's financial regulations, consult with local legal counsel, and establish a policy framework for regulatory engagement before any stablecoin operations begin

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance for virtual asset service providers

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT policies exist

**Gap:** Missing anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing policies required for financial service providers in Kosovo

**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, potential criminal liability, reputational damage, and exclusion from financial systems

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive AML/CFT policies including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and record-keeping procedures aligned with Kosovo's Financial Intelligence Unit requirements

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Licensing and registration requirements

**Current Status:** No licensing strategy or documentation

**Gap:** Missing approach to obtaining necessary licenses or registrations from Kosovo's financial authorities

**Impact:** Illegal operations, immediate regulatory shutdown, and potential criminal prosecution

**Recommendation:** Establish licensing strategy including identification of required licenses, application process, ongoing compliance monitoring, and regulatory relationship management

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements

**Recommendation:** Establish consumer protection framework including clear terms of service, risk disclosures, complaint resolution procedures, and data protection measures compliant with Kosovo's consumer protection laws

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Reserve management and transparency requirements

**Recommendation:** Implement reserve management policy specifying asset composition, custody arrangements, regular independent audits, and public reporting of reserve status

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational risk management framework

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive operational risk management framework including cybersecurity protocols, business continuity planning, incident response procedures, and regular testing
