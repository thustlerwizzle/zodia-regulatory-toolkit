Keys must never be stored in plaintext or on internet-connected devices.\n2.  **Access Control:** Access to private keys is strictly limited on a need-to-know basis. Multi-signature (multi-sig) schemes with a defined threshold (m-of-n) are required for authorizing critical transactions.\n3.  **Custody Solutions:** The use of qualified institutional custodians for reserve assets is required, subject to due diligence.\n4.  **Key Rotation & Revocation:** Procedures for periodic key rotation and immediate revocation in case of suspected compromise must be established and tested.\n\n### 5.3 Business Continuity Planning (BCP)\n1.  **Business Impact Analysis (BIA):** A formal BIA must be conducted annually to identify critical business functions, their dependencies, and maximum tolerable downtime.\n2.  **Plan Development:** A documented BCP must be maintained, detailing recovery strategies, alternate site provisions, and resource requirements for all critical functions.\n3.  **Communication Plan:** The BCP must include a crisis communication strategy for internal stakeholders, regulators, and the public.\n4.  **Testing & Exercises:** The BCP must be tested at least annually through tabletop exercises or full simulations.\n\n### 5.4 Incident Response Plan (IRP)\n1.  **Incident Classification:** A clear taxonomy for classifying security incidents (e.g., Severity 1-4) based on impact must be established.\n2.  **Response Team:** A designated Cross-Functional Incident Response Team (CIRT) with defined roles and responsibilities must be in place.\n3.  **Response Phases:** The IRP must detail procedures for:\n    *   **Preparation:** Training and tooling.\n    *   **Identification & Containment:** Detecting and limiting the scope of an incident.\n    *   **Eradication & Recovery:** Removing the threat and restoring systems.\n    *   **Post-Incident Review:** Conducting a root cause analysis and implementing corrective actions (lessons learned).\n4.  **Reporting:** Internal and external reporting timelines, including those mandated by regulators, must be explicitly defined and followed.\n\n### 5.5 Regular Security Audits\n1.  **Schedule:** A comprehensive, external security audit of the entire stablecoin technological stack and operational controls must be conducted at least annually.\n2.  **Scope:** Audits must cover smart contracts, off-chain infrastructure, key management practices, and compliance with this policy.\n3.  **Remediation:** All audit findings will be tracked in a risk register. High and critical-risk findings must be remediated within agreed-upon, strict timelines.\n4.  **Internal Reviews:** Internal control reviews and vulnerability assessments must be performed quarterly.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n*   All personnel are responsible for understanding and complying with this policy.\n*   The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) or equivalent is responsible for overall oversight and implementation.\n*   The Technology and Security departments are responsible for executing the technical controls.\n*   Non-compliance may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination, and may expose the organization to significant financial and reputational harm.\n*   Evidence of compliance (audit reports, test results, logs) must be maintained for a minimum of [e.g., 5] years.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule\nThis policy shall be reviewed and updated:\n*   **Annually** as part of the enterprise risk management cycle.\n*   **Ad-hoc** following a significant security incident, major technological change, or change in applicable laws or regulations.\n*   All updates require approval from the [e.g., Risk Committee or Board of Directors].\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements\nThis policy is designed to align with and support compliance with relevant regulatory expectations, including but not limited to principles outlined by:\n*   The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) frameworks for operational risk.\n*   Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations on virtual assets.\n*   Relevant national and state-level regulations pertaining to money transmission, digital assets, and cybersecurity (e.g., NYDFS Part 500, EU's DORA, etc.).\n*   Future stablecoin-specific legislation (e.g., potential U.S. stablecoin laws).\n\n---\n**Policy Version:** 1.0  \n**Effective Date:** [Date]  \n**Approved By:** [Name/Title of Approver]\n```"

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Greenland\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-02-07T10:36:01.288782\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company exhibits a complete lack of policies addressing Greenland's stablecoin regulatory requirements. All core regulatory areas show 'not_met' status, indicating significant compliance risk. Immediate action is required to develop comprehensive policies, particularly for regulatory authorization, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance. Given Greenland's likely alignment with EU/EEA financial regulations, the company should prepare for stringent oversight requirements. The absence of any documented policies suggests the company is not operationally ready for stablecoin issuance in regulated jurisdictions.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance requires authorization from Greenland's financial regulator (likely under Danish/Greenlandic financial supervision framework)\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy for stablecoin issuance or regulatory authorization process\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing regulatory authorization requirements for issuing stablecoins in Greenland\n\n**Impact:** Potential regulatory enforcement actions, fines, prohibition of operations, and reputational damage\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop a comprehensive regulatory authorization policy including: 1) Application process for regulatory approval, 2) Documentation requirements, 3) Engagement protocol with Greenlandic/Danish financial authorities, 4) Timeline and milestone tracking\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must maintain adequate reserves (likely following EU/EEA standards for e-money or payment services)\n\n**Current Status:** No reserve management or asset backing policies documented\n\n**Gap:** Missing policies governing reserve composition, custody, auditing, and transparency requirements\n\n**Impact:** Risk of insolvency, loss of peg, regulatory sanctions, and loss of consumer trust\n\n**Recommendation:** Create reserve management policy specifying: 1) Eligible reserve assets, 2) Custody arrangements, 3) Regular auditing requirements, 4) Public disclosure framework, 5) Liquidity management procedures\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance for stablecoin transactions (following Greenland's implementation of EU AML directives)\n\n**Current Status:** No specific AML/CFT policies for stablecoin operations\n\n**Gap:** Lack of transaction monitoring, customer due diligence, and suspicious activity reporting procedures tailored to stablecoin activities\n\n**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties, potential criminal liability, and exclusion from financial systems\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop stablecoin-specific AML/CFT policy including: 1) Risk-based customer verification, 2) Transaction monitoring thresholds, 3) Reporting procedures to Greenlandic Financial Intelligence Unit, 4) Record-keeping requirements\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including redemption rights and disclosures\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement consumer protection policy covering: 1) Redemption procedures and timelines, 2) Fee disclosure requirements, 3) Complaint handling process, 4) Terms of service transparency\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity requirements\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish operational risk framework including: 1) Smart contract security protocols, 2) Private key management procedures, 3) Business continuity planning, 4) Incident response plan, 5) Regular security audits\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **regulatory_authorization_requirement**: not_met\n❌ **reserve_management_requirement**: not_met\n❌ **aml_cft_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **consumer_protection**: not_met\n❌ **operational_risk_management**: not_met\n❌ **governance_requirements**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update Summary\nGenerated: 2026-02-07T10:36:36.298156\n\n## Overview\nThis document summarizes proposed
