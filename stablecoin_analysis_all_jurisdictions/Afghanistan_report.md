# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T05:02:51.383484

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company appears to have no established policies for stablecoin operations in Afghanistan or for serving Afghan customers. This represents an extreme compliance risk given Afghanistan's complex regulatory environment, international sanctions regime, and high-risk financial crime profile. Immediate action is required to suspend operations and develop comprehensive compliance frameworks before any further business activities involving Afghanistan can be considered. The complete absence of policies across all regulatory domains indicates either a new market entry without proper preparation or a significant oversight in compliance program development.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Legal framework for stablecoin issuance and operation

**Current Status:** No policies identified

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing stablecoin operations in Afghanistan or for Afghan customers

**Impact:** Legal exposure, potential regulatory enforcement actions, inability to operate legally in Afghanistan

**Recommendation:** Immediately suspend all stablecoin operations involving Afghanistan until regulatory landscape is clarified. Conduct comprehensive regulatory research on Afghanistan's financial regulations, central bank directives, and any existing or proposed digital asset frameworks.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance for digital assets

**Current Status:** No policies identified

**Gap:** No anti-money laundering or counter-terrorism financing policies specific to stablecoin transactions

**Impact:** High risk of facilitating illicit financial flows, potential sanctions violations, reputational damage

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive AML/CFT policies for stablecoin operations including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and sanctions screening specific to Afghanistan's risk profile.

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Licensing and registration requirements

**Current Status:** No policies identified

**Gap:** No policies addressing licensing requirements for operating in Afghanistan or serving Afghan customers

**Impact:** Operating without required licenses, potential criminal liability, asset seizure

**Recommendation:** Conduct immediate legal assessment of licensing requirements in Afghanistan. Engage local legal counsel to determine if stablecoin operations require money transmitter, payment service provider, or other financial licenses.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Reserve requirements and transparency

**Recommendation:** Establish reserve management policies requiring 1:1 backing with high-quality liquid assets, independent custody arrangements, and regular public attestations of reserve holdings.

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures

**Recommendation:** Implement consumer protection policies including clear terms of service, redemption rights, fee transparency, and complaint resolution mechanisms.

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Cross-border transaction compliance

**Recommendation:** Develop cross-border transaction policies including geographic restrictions, sanctions compliance checks, and reporting requirements for transactions involving Afghanistan.
