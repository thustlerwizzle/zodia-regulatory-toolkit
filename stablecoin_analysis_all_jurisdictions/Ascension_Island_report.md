# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-12T13:51:35.066556

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits a complete absence of documented policies addressing stablecoin regulatory requirements. Based on standard regulatory expectations for stablecoin issuers globally and emerging frameworks in jurisdictions like Ascension Island (which typically follows UK/EU regulatory trends), the company is in a state of non-compliance across all critical regulatory domains. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive compliance program, beginning with licensing strategy, AML/CTF implementation, and reserve management frameworks. The lack of basic policies creates existential regulatory risk and prevents lawful operation in most jurisdictions.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Legal authorization/licensing for stablecoin issuance and operation

**Current Status:** No documented policy exists

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing licensing requirements for stablecoin operations in Ascension Island or other jurisdictions where the company operates

**Impact:** Risk of regulatory enforcement actions, fines, business shutdown, and potential criminal liability for operating without required licenses

**Recommendation:** 1. Conduct jurisdictional analysis to determine applicable licensing requirements. 2. Develop licensing acquisition strategy. 3. Create policy framework for maintaining licenses and regulatory registrations.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Reserve requirements and asset backing for stablecoins

**Current Status:** No documented policy exists

**Gap:** No policies governing reserve composition, custody, auditing, or redemption mechanisms for stablecoin backing assets

**Impact:** Risk of insolvency, loss of peg, regulatory sanctions, loss of customer trust, and potential fraud allegations

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop comprehensive reserve management policy. 2. Establish custody arrangements with qualified custodians. 3. Implement regular third-party audits. 4. Create transparent disclosure framework for reserve composition.

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance

**Current Status:** No documented policy exists

**Gap:** Complete absence of AML/CTF policies, procedures, customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, or suspicious activity reporting

**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, loss of banking relationships, reputational damage, and potential criminal liability for facilitating illicit finance

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop comprehensive AML/CTF program. 2. Implement customer identification and verification procedures. 3. Establish transaction monitoring system. 4. Designate AML compliance officer. 5. Create suspicious activity reporting protocols.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop comprehensive consumer protection policy. 2. Create clear risk disclosure documents. 3. Establish complaint handling and dispute resolution procedures. 4. Implement transparent fee disclosure framework.

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop comprehensive operational risk management framework. 2. Implement cybersecurity controls and incident response plan. 3. Establish business continuity and disaster recovery procedures. 4. Create third-party vendor risk management policy.

### Gap 3: GAP-007
**Requirement:** Cross-border compliance and jurisdictional analysis

**Recommendation:** 1. Conduct comprehensive jurisdictional analysis. 2. Develop cross-border compliance policy. 3. Create regulatory change management process. 4. Establish geographic restrictions framework.
