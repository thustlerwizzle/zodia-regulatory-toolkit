# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-06T00:06:56.453748

## Executive Summary
Overall compliance status is severely deficient. The company currently has no documented policies addressing the core regulatory pillars for stablecoin operations in Liberia. The organization is operating in a state of extreme non-compliance, exposing it to critical legal, financial, and reputational risks. Immediate and comprehensive policy development is required, starting with securing legal authorization and implementing AML/CFT controls, before any commercial activity can be considered. This is a foundational, not incremental, compliance challenge.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Legal authorization and licensing for stablecoin issuance and operations in Liberia

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** Company lacks any policy addressing the fundamental requirement to obtain proper authorization from Liberian financial regulators (likely the Central Bank of Liberia) to issue, manage, or facilitate stablecoin transactions.

**Impact:** Operating without a license constitutes illegal activity, leading to severe penalties, criminal prosecution, forced cessation of operations, and irreparable reputational damage.

**Recommendation:** Immediately suspend all stablecoin-related activities in Liberia. Initiate formal engagement with the Central Bank of Liberia to understand the licensing framework. Develop a 'Market Entry and Licensing Policy' that outlines the steps, requirements, and responsible parties for obtaining the necessary authorization.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Adherence to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) regulations applicable in Liberia.

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** No policies exist for customer due diligence (CDD), know your customer (KYC), transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting (SAR), or record-keeping as mandated by Liberian AML/CFT laws (e.g., the Financial Intelligence Agency Act).

**Impact:** High risk of facilitating financial crime, leading to regulatory sanctions, hefty fines, loss of correspondent banking relationships, and potential criminal liability for the company and its directors.

**Recommendation:** Develop a comprehensive 'AML/CFT Compliance Policy' for Liberia, aligned with FATF recommendations and local law. This must include risk-based CDD/KYC procedures, ongoing monitoring, a designated Compliance Officer, and clear protocols for reporting to the Financial Intelligence Unit of Liberia (FIU).

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Maintenance of adequate reserves to back stablecoin value (e.g., 1:1 backing with high-quality liquid assets).

**Recommendation:** Create a 'Reserve Management and Transparency Policy'. This should define eligible reserve assets (e.g., cash, short-term government securities), mandate segregation and custody with a regulated third party, require monthly attestations and annual full-reserve audits by a reputable firm, and commit to public disclosure of reserve composition and audit results.

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures, including clear disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling.

**Recommendation:** Implement a 'Consumer Protection and Redemption Policy'. This must include clear, accessible terms of service, a detailed fee schedule, a guaranteed and operational redemption mechanism, and a formal complaints management procedure with defined resolution timelines.

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Cybersecurity and operational resilience standards to protect user funds and data.

**Recommendation:** Develop and enforce a 'Cybersecurity and Operational Resilience Framework'. This should include secure key management (preferably using MPC or HSMs), regular penetration testing, an incident response plan, and a business continuity plan that ensures redemption functionality remains available during disruptions.
