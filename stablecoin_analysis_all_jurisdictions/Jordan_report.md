# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-31T06:13:08.576093

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no policies addressing stablecoin regulation in Jordan, representing a complete regulatory gap. All seven identified regulatory requirements are unmet, with four classified as critical priorities. The company cannot legally operate stablecoin services in Jordan without immediate and comprehensive policy development, licensing engagement with the Central Bank of Jordan, and implementation of foundational compliance controls. The most urgent gaps relate to licensing, reserve backing, and AML/CFT compliance, which carry severe legal and operational risks if not addressed before any market entry or continued operations.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance requires licensing from the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) under the Payment Systems and Services Regulation

**Current Status:** No documented policy for stablecoin issuance or operation

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing licensing requirements for stablecoin operations in Jordan

**Impact:** Legal prohibition of operations, potential criminal liability, regulatory enforcement actions including fines and shutdown

**Recommendation:** Immediately suspend any stablecoin operations until proper licensing is obtained. Develop a licensing strategy document and engage with CBJ's FinTech Regulatory Sandbox for guidance.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Full reserve backing requirement for stablecoins with assets held in segregated accounts at licensed Jordanian banks

**Current Status:** No reserve management policy exists

**Gap:** Missing policies for reserve composition, custody, segregation, and regular attestation

**Impact:** Regulatory shutdown, loss of customer funds, criminal charges for misrepresentation of backing

**Recommendation:** Develop a comprehensive reserve management policy specifying: 1) Acceptable reserve assets (likely Jordanian Dinar, USD, or high-quality government securities), 2) Segregated account requirements, 3) Daily reconciliation procedures, 4) Quarterly attestation by licensed auditors

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance under Jordan's Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Law No. 20 of 2021

**Current Status:** No specific AML/CFT policy for stablecoin operations

**Gap:** Lack of customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting procedures tailored to stablecoin transactions

**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, license revocation, reputational damage, potential criminal liability

**Recommendation:** Implement a stablecoin-specific AML/CFT program including: 1) Enhanced due diligence for wallet addresses, 2) Transaction monitoring for unusual patterns, 3) Travel rule compliance for cross-border transfers, 4) Regular reporting to Jordan's Financial Intelligence Unit

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection requirements including clear disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive consumer protection policies covering: 1) Clear redemption terms and timelines, 2) Fee transparency, 3) Risk disclosures, 4) Complaint escalation procedures, 5) Data protection in compliance with Jordan's Personal Data Protection Law

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity standards as per CBJ's expectations for payment service providers

**Recommendation:** Establish an operational risk management framework including: 1) Smart contract audit requirements, 2) Multi-signature wallet controls, 3) Disaster recovery planning, 4) Regular penetration testing, 5) Incident response protocols for hacks or technical failures

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Regular reporting to the Central Bank of Jordan including financial statements, transaction volumes, and compliance reports

**Recommendation:** Develop a regulatory reporting manual specifying: 1) Required reports and frequencies, 2) Data collection procedures, 3) Report templates, 4) Submission timelines, 5) Designated compliance officer responsibilities
