## Regulatory Requirements Summary

## **Summary of Cryptocurrency, Digital Asset & Blockchain Regulatory Research Findings**

**Analysis Period:** January 2026  
**Primary Themes:** Stablecoin regulation, jurisdictional divergence (US vs. UK), inter-agency coordination, and market structure.

---

### **1. Key Regulatory Requirements & Compliance Obligations**

*   **Stablecoin Issuance & Reserves:** A core regulatory focus is establishing clear rules for stablecoin issuance, including requirements for **high-quality liquid asset (HQLA) reserves**, redemption policies, and issuer licensing. Compliance mandates transparency in reserve composition and regular attestations/audits.
*   **Market Structure Classification:** Regulations are evolving to define whether digital assets are **securities (under SEC purview) or commodities (under CFTC purview)**. Compliance requires issuers and trading platforms to determine asset classification to apply correct registration, disclosure, and market conduct rules.
*   **Entity Registration:** Exchanges, custodians, and brokers are facing requirements to register with relevant national authorities (e.g., as **Money Services Businesses (MSBs)** in the U.S., or with the **Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)** in the UK), implementing AML/KYC, consumer protection, and operational resilience programs.

### **2. Recent Regulatory Changes & Developments**

*   **United States: Legislative & Agency Action**
    *   **Pending Legislation:** The **U.S. market structure bill** is a significant legislative effort but faces delays, primarily due to **debates over stablecoin regulatory provisions** (specifically, whether state or federal regulators should have primary authority).
    *   **Regulatory Harmonization:** The **SEC and CFTC are hosting a joint event** to discuss oversight harmonization, signaling a potential shift towards more coordinated federal regulation under the current administration's push to "welcome the sector."
*   **United Kingdom: Finalized Framework**
    *   The UK has **finalized its comprehensive crypto asset regulatory regime**, bringing crypto activities under existing financial services laws. This provides a clearer compliance pathway for firms compared to the current U.S. environment, which the research characterizes as "bogged down."

### **3. Jurisdiction-Specific Requirements**

*   **United States:**
    *   **Dual Regulatory Framework:** The **SEC** regulates securities-like assets, while the **CFTC** oversees commodity-based crypto and derivatives. The **Treasury** (via FinCEN) sets AML standards.
    *   **State-Level Requirements:** Stablecoin and money transmitter laws vary by state, creating a complex patchwork. New entrants (like Tether's **USAT**) must ensure compliance at both federal and state levels to operate.
*   **United Kingdom:**
    *   A **unified regulatory approach** under the **FCA** requires crypto asset firms to be authorized, following rules on financial promotions, market abuse, and custody.

### **4. Enforcement Actions & Regulatory Guidance**

*   **Enforcement Focus (Implied):** The stablecoin debate in the U.S. centers on **preventing systemic risk and protecting depositors**, with regulators concerned about yield-bearing stablecoins potentially acting as unregulated deposit-taking entities. This suggests future enforcement may target products that blur lines between payment instruments and banking services.
*   **Guidance Through Market Entry:** The launch of **Tether's U.S.-regulated USAT stablecoin** serves as a de facto case study in compliance, demonstrating the operational requirements for a "compliant digital dollar" in the U.S. market.
*   **Regulatory Stance:** The UK's finalized rules represent **formal, prescriptive guidance**, whereas the U.S. currently relies more on **enforcement actions and evolving legislative negotiations** for guidance, creating regulatory uncertainty.

### **5. Overall Compliance Outlook**

The regulatory landscape is **diverging sharply between the UK and the U.S.** The UK offers a **defined, albeit stringent, compliance path**. The U.S. remains in a **period of high uncertainty**, with compliance obligations dependent on the unresolved market structure bill and the outcome of SEC-CFTC harmonization talks. **Stablecoins are the primary regulatory battleground**, with compliance hinging on forthcoming definitions of their legal character and appropriate reserve/issuer requirements. Firms must prepare for **increased clarity in the UK and potential seismic shifts in the U.S. regulatory approach** in the near term.


# Gap Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
The company's current policy framework shows a critical and comprehensive lack of alignment with the evolving regulatory landscape for digital assets. There are no foundational policies addressing core requirements such as stablecoin issuance, asset classification, or entity registration in key markets like the U.S. and UK. The compliance status is 'not met' across all major regulatory themes, indicating the company is not operationally ready to engage in regulated crypto asset activities. Immediate action is required to develop a baseline compliance program, with critical priority given to licensing strategy, asset classification, and stablecoin governance to avoid severe legal and operational consequences.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance requires high-quality liquid asset (HQLA) reserves, redemption policies, issuer licensing, and transparency with regular attestations/audits.

**Current Status:** No stablecoin issuance or reserve management policies documented.

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies governing stablecoin issuance, reserve composition, redemption mechanisms, or audit requirements.

**Impact:** Inability to issue or support stablecoins legally; high risk of regulatory enforcement, fines, and operational shutdown; significant reputational damage.

**Recommendation:** Develop and implement a comprehensive Stablecoin Issuance & Reserve Management Policy. This must define HQLA criteria, redemption procedures, licensing strategy, and require quarterly attestations and annual audits by a qualified third party.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Digital assets must be classified as securities or commodities to determine applicable registration, disclosure, and market conduct rules under SEC or CFTC jurisdiction.

**Current Status:** No documented process for digital asset classification or jurisdictional analysis.

**Gap:** Lack of a formal framework to analyze and classify digital assets, leading to uncertainty about which regulatory regimes (SEC, CFTC) apply.

**Impact:** Risk of operating an unregistered securities exchange or offering unregistered securities; dual enforcement risk from SEC and CFTC; potential for severe penalties and cease-and-desist orders.

**Recommendation:** Establish a Digital Asset Classification Policy. Create a formal internal review committee and process, leveraging legal counsel, to apply the Howey Test and other relevant frameworks to each asset before listing or offering.

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Exchanges, custodians, and brokers must register with relevant authorities (e.g., as MSBs with FinCEN in the U.S., or with the FCA in the UK) and implement AML/KYC, consumer protection, and operational resilience programs.

**Current Status:** No documented entity registration strategy or compliance program for key jurisdictions (US/UK).

**Gap:** No clear plan for mandatory registrations (MSB, state money transmitter licenses, FCA authorization) or corresponding comprehensive compliance programs.

**Impact:** Operating without necessary licenses is illegal; exposes the company to criminal and civil liability, asset seizure, and permanent exclusion from regulated markets.

**Recommendation:** Immediately initiate a jurisdictional licensing assessment. For target markets (US/UK), map all required registrations and begin application processes concurrently with the development of a Global Compliance Program covering AML/KYC, Consumer Protection, and Operational Resilience.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** In the U.S., compliance with a dual federal (SEC/CFTC) and state-level regulatory patchwork, especially for money transmission and stablecoins.

**Recommendation:** Develop a U.S. State Compliance Strategy. Prioritize obtaining money transmitter licenses in key states and create a policy for ongoing monitoring and adherence to state-specific stablecoin and consumer finance laws.

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** In the UK, firms must be authorized by the FCA and comply with unified rules on financial promotions, market abuse, and custody.

**Recommendation:** Draft a UK Market Entry Policy. Outline the process for FCA authorization and adapt existing/compliance policies to meet UK-specific rules on crypto asset promotions (fair, clear, not misleading) and market abuse monitoring.

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Regulatory focus on preventing systemic risk and protecting depositors, particularly regarding yield-bearing stablecoins that may resemble unregulated banking.

**Recommendation:** Implement a Product Governance & Regulatory Risk Review Policy. Mandate a legal and compliance review for all new products, especially those involving yield, lending, or stablecoins, to assess and mitigate banking law risks.
