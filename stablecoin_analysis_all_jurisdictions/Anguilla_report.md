# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-12T13:26:21.907466

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits a complete absence of documented policies for stablecoin operations in Anguilla, representing critical non-compliance with fundamental regulatory requirements. All seven identified regulatory areas are currently not met. Immediate action is required to develop comprehensive policies and initiate licensing applications before commencing operations. The most critical gaps involve licensing, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance, which could result in severe regulatory sanctions and business prohibition if not addressed urgently. A phased implementation approach is recommended, starting with critical priorities while developing the full compliance framework.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must be licensed or registered with Anguilla's Financial Services Commission (FSC) under the Financial Services Commission Act and related regulations.

**Current Status:** No documented policy for regulatory registration or licensing in Anguilla.

**Gap:** Complete absence of policy addressing mandatory licensing/registration requirements for stablecoin operations in Anguilla.

**Impact:** Operating without required license could result in enforcement actions, fines, business suspension, reputational damage, and potential criminal liability.

**Recommendation:** Immediately initiate FSC licensing application process. Develop comprehensive licensing policy covering application requirements, ongoing compliance, and reporting obligations.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must maintain adequate reserves (typically 100% backing) with qualified custodians and undergo regular independent audits.

**Current Status:** No documented reserve management or audit policy.

**Gap:** Missing policies for reserve composition, custody arrangements, audit frequency, and transparency reporting.

**Impact:** Failure to maintain adequate reserves could lead to insolvency, loss of consumer funds, regulatory sanctions, and loss of market confidence.

**Recommendation:** Develop Reserve Management Policy specifying: 1) Composition of reserves (cash, cash equivalents, government securities), 2) Custodian selection criteria, 3) Monthly reserve attestations, 4) Quarterly independent audits, 5) Public disclosure framework.

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance under Anguilla's Proceeds of Crime Act and Anti-Money Laundering Regulations, including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting.

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT policy specific to stablecoin operations.

**Gap:** Lack of risk-based AML/CFT program tailored to stablecoin transactions, including KYC, transaction monitoring, and SAR procedures.

**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties, loss of banking relationships, potential criminal liability for money laundering offenses.

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive AML/CFT Policy including: 1) Risk assessment methodology, 2) Tiered KYC procedures, 3) Transaction monitoring rules for blockchain analysis, 4) SAR procedures with FSC reporting protocols, 5) Employee training program.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection requirements including clear disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling procedures.

**Recommendation:** Create Consumer Protection Policy covering: 1) Clear terms of service, 2) Fee transparency, 3) Redemption procedures and timelines, 4) Complaint handling with escalation procedures, 5) User education materials.

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Cybersecurity and operational resilience requirements for digital asset service providers.

**Recommendation:** Develop Cybersecurity Policy including: 1) Multi-signature wallet protocols, 2) Cold storage procedures, 3) Incident response plan, 4) Regular penetration testing, 5) Business continuity and disaster recovery plans.

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Regular reporting to FSC including financial statements, compliance reports, and significant incident notifications.

**Recommendation:** Establish Regulatory Reporting Policy specifying: 1) Reporting calendar with deadlines, 2) Report templates and content requirements, 3) Review and approval workflow, 4) Record retention procedures, 5) Designated compliance officer responsibilities.
