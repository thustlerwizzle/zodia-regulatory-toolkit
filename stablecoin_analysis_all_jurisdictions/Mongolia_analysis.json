Purpose and Scope  \n**Purpose:**  \nThis policy establishes a clear legal framework for the classification and regulatory treatment of stablecoins in Mongolia. It aims to protect consumers, ensure financial stability, prevent illicit activities, and foster responsible innovation in the digital asset ecosystem by aligning with the mandates of the Bank of Mongolia (BoM) and the Financial Regulatory Commission (FRC).\n\n**Scope:**  \nThis policy applies to all entities issuing, distributing, exchanging, or providing custody services for stablecoins within Mongolia, as well as to all financial institutions and payment service providers interacting with stablecoin activities. It covers all stablecoins, regardless of their underlying technological architecture or issuance jurisdiction, if they are offered to persons within Mongolia.\n\n## 3. Definitions  \n- **Stablecoin:** A type of cryptocurrency or digital asset that is designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified reference asset or a pool of assets (e.g., a fiat currency like the Mongolian Tugrik (MNT) or US Dollar, a commodity, or a basket of assets).\n- **Issuer:** The legal entity that creates, issues, and has the obligation to redeem the stablecoin.\n- **Bank of Mongolia (BoM):** The central bank of Mongolia, responsible for monetary policy, currency issuance, and payment system oversight.\n- **Financial Regulatory Commission (FRC):** The independent regulatory body responsible for supervising non-bank financial markets and services in Mongolia.\n- **Fiat-Backed Stablecoin:** A stablecoin where the value is backed 1:1 by a reserve of fiat currency held in custody.\n- **Asset-Backed Stablecoin:** A stablecoin backed by a reserve of other assets (e.g., commodities, securities, or other cryptocurrencies).\n- **Algorithmic Stablecoin:** A stablecoin that maintains its peg through algorithmic mechanisms and smart contracts controlling supply, without being fully backed by reserve assets.\n- **Payment Instrument:** As defined by Mongolian law, any instrument, whether tangible or intangible, that enables the holder to transfer money.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement  \nIt is the policy of the relevant Mongolian authorities, as guided by the BoM and FRC, to classify stablecoins based on their economic function, structure, and inherent risks. This classification will determine their legal status and corresponding regulatory treatment. The primary classifications are:\n\n- **Payment Instrument / E-Money:** Stablecoins that are primarily designed and used as a means of payment or exchange for goods and services, and are backed one-to-one by high-quality, liquid assets (primarily fiat currency). These will fall under the regulatory purview of the **Bank of Mongolia** and be subject to e-money/payment services regulations.\n- **Security:** Stablecoins whose value is derived from an investment in an underlying pool of assets (beyond simple fiat backing) and where holders have an expectation of profit primarily from the efforts of the issuer or a third party. These will be classified as securities and fall under the regulatory purview of the **Financial Regulatory Commission**, subject to securities laws.\n- **Currency (Digital Currency):** Stablecoins that are issued or explicitly guaranteed by a sovereign state (including potential future Central Bank Digital Currency - CBDC). Currently, only the Mongolian Tugrik issued by the BoM is recognized as legal tender. No privately issued stablecoin shall be classified as \"currency.\"\n\nAll stablecoin offerings must undergo a mandatory legal review process before being offered in the Mongolian market.\n\n## 5. Procedures  \n**5.1. Classification Determination Process:**  \n1. **Pre-Issuance Review:** Any entity intending to offer a stablecoin in Mongolia must submit a \"Stablecoin Classification Application\" to a Joint Working Group comprised of BoM and FRC representatives.\n2. **Application Contents:** The application must include:\n    - Whitepaper and technical documentation.\n    - Legal structure of the issuer and the stablecoin.\n    - Detailed description of the stabilization mechanism and reserve assets.\n    - Rights and obligations of holders.\n    - Redemption policy and procedures.\n    - Risk disclosures.\n    - AML/CFT compliance framework.\n3. **Assessment:** The Joint Working Group will assess the stablecoin against the criteria in Section 4 within 90 calendar days of receiving a complete application.\n4. **Determination Notice:** The issuer will receive a formal written determination of the stablecoin's classification and the primary regulatory authority.\n\n**5.2. Legal Review Process for Offerings:**  \n1. Following classification, the issuer must submit a full regulatory application to the relevant authority (BoM for Payment Instruments, FRC for Securities).\n2. The application will be reviewed for compliance with all applicable laws, including but not limited to: licensing, consumer protection, reserve auditing, custody, cybersecurity, and anti-money laundering requirements.\n3. Approval from the relevant authority is required before any public offering, marketing, or distribution within Mongolia.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements  \nEntities involved with stablecoins must comply with all regulations applicable to their classification:\n- **For Payment Instrument Stablecoins:** Compliance with the BoM's regulations on payment service providers, e-money issuance, capital adequacy, reserve safeguarding (daily attestation, monthly audits), and stringent AML/CFT rules.\n- **For Security Stablecoins:** Compliance with FRC securities laws, including registration of the offering, disclosure obligations, fiduciary duties, custody of underlying assets, and investor suitability assessments.\n- **For All Stablecoins:** Adherence to Mongolian AML/CFT laws, data privacy laws, consumer protection standards, and regular reporting to the relevant regulator. Issuers must maintain transparent, publicly available proof of reserves.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule  \nThis policy shall be reviewed and updated:\n- **Annually** by the BoM and FRC to account for technological and market developments.\n- **Immediately** following any major change in Mongolian financial or securities law.\n- **As needed** in response to significant stablecoin market events or international regulatory developments.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements  \nThis policy is formulated with reference to and in anticipation of alignment with the following Mongolian legal and regulatory frameworks:\n- The **Law of Mongolia on Central Bank (Bank of Mongolia)**\n- The **Law on Payment and Settlement Systems**\n- The **Securities Market Law**\n- The **Law on Prevention of Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism**\n- The **Civil Code of Mongolia** (regarding obligations and property)\n- Guidance and directives issued by the **Bank of Mongolia** and the **Financial Regulatory Commission**.\n- *Note: Specific amendments or new legislation may be required to fully enact this policy's provisions.*\n\n---\n**Policy Effective Date:** [Date to be determined upon formal adoption]  \n**Issuing Authorities:** Bank of Mongolia & Financial Regulatory Commission of Mongolia\n```"

Purpose and Scope  \n**Purpose:**  \nThis policy establishes a clear legal framework for the classification and regulatory treatment of stablecoins in Mongolia. It aims to protect consumers, ensure financial stability, prevent illicit activities, and foster responsible innovation in the digital asset ecosystem by aligning with the mandates of the Bank of Mongolia (BoM) and the Financial Regulatory Commission (FRC).\n\n**Scope:**  \nThis policy applies to all entities issuing, distributing, exchanging, or providing custody services for stablecoins within Mongolia, as well as to all financial institutions and payment service providers interacting with stablecoin activities. It covers all stablecoins, regardless of their underlying technological architecture or issuance jurisdiction, if they are offered to persons within Mongolia.\n\n## 3. Definitions  \n- **Stablecoin:** A type of cryptocurrency or digital asset that is designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified reference asset or a pool of assets (e.g., a fiat currency like the Mongolian Tugrik (MNT) or US Dollar, a commodity, or a basket of assets).\n- **Issuer:** The legal entity that creates, issues, and has the obligation to redeem the stablecoin.\n- **Bank of Mongolia (BoM):** The central bank of Mongolia, responsible for monetary policy, currency issuance, and payment system oversight.\n- **Financial Regulatory Commission (FRC):** The independent regulatory body responsible for supervising non-bank financial markets and services in Mongolia.\n- **Fiat-Backed Stablecoin:** A stablecoin where the value is backed 1:1 by a reserve of fiat currency held in custody.\n- **Asset-Backed Stablecoin:** A stablecoin backed by a reserve of other assets (e.g., commodities, securities, or other cryptocurrencies).\n- **Algorithmic Stablecoin:** A stablecoin that maintains its peg through algorithmic mechanisms and smart contracts controlling supply, without being fully backed by reserve assets.\n- **Payment Instrument:** As defined by Mongolian law, any instrument, whether tangible or intangible, that enables the holder to transfer money.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement  \nIt is the policy of the relevant Mongolian authorities, as guided by the BoM and FRC, to classify stablecoins based on their economic function, structure, and inherent risks. This classification will determine their legal status and corresponding regulatory treatment. The primary classifications are:\n\n- **Payment Instrument / E-Money:** Stablecoins that are primarily designed and used as a means of payment or exchange for goods and services, and are backed one-to-one by high-quality, liquid assets (primarily fiat currency). These will fall under the regulatory purview of the **Bank of Mongolia** and be subject to e-money/payment services regulations.\n- **Security:** Stablecoins whose value is derived from an investment in an underlying pool of assets (beyond simple fiat backing) and where holders have an expectation of profit primarily from the efforts of the issuer or a third party. These will be classified as securities and fall under the regulatory purview of the **Financial Regulatory Commission**, subject to securities laws.\n- **Currency (Digital Currency):** Stablecoins that are issued or explicitly guaranteed by a sovereign state (including potential future Central Bank Digital Currency - CBDC). Currently, only the Mongolian Tugrik issued by the BoM is recognized as legal tender. No privately issued stablecoin shall be classified as \"currency.\"\n\nAll stablecoin offerings must undergo a mandatory legal review process before being offered in the Mongolian market.\n\n## 5. Procedures  \n**5.1. Classification Determination Process:**  \n1. **Pre-Issuance Review:** Any entity intending to offer a stablecoin in Mongolia must submit a \"Stablecoin Classification Application\" to a Joint Working Group comprised of BoM and FRC representatives.\n2. **Application Contents:** The application must include:\n    - Whitepaper and technical documentation.\n    - Legal structure of the issuer and the stablecoin.\n    - Detailed description of the stabilization mechanism and reserve assets.\n    - Rights and obligations of holders.\n    - Redemption policy and procedures.\n    - Risk disclosures.\n    - AML/CFT compliance framework.\n3. **Assessment:** The Joint Working Group will assess the stablecoin against the criteria in Section 4 within 90 calendar days of receiving a complete application.\n4. **Determination Notice:** The issuer will receive a formal written determination of the stablecoin's classification and the primary regulatory authority.\n\n**5.2. Legal Review Process for Offerings:**  \n1. Following classification, the issuer must submit a full regulatory application to the relevant authority (BoM for Payment Instruments, FRC for Securities).\n2. The application will be reviewed for compliance with all applicable laws, including but not limited to: licensing, consumer protection, reserve auditing, custody, cybersecurity, and anti-money laundering requirements.\n3. Approval from the relevant authority is required before any public offering, marketing, or distribution within Mongolia.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements  \nEntities involved with stablecoins must comply with all regulations applicable to their classification:\n- **For Payment Instrument Stablecoins:** Compliance with the BoM's regulations on payment service providers, e-money issuance, capital adequacy, reserve safeguarding (daily attestation, monthly audits), and stringent AML/CFT rules.\n- **For Security Stablecoins:** Compliance with FRC securities laws, including registration of the offering, disclosure obligations, fiduciary duties, custody of underlying assets, and investor suitability assessments.\n- **For All Stablecoins:** Adherence to Mongolian AML/CFT laws, data privacy laws, consumer protection standards, and regular reporting to the relevant regulator. Issuers must maintain transparent, publicly available proof of reserves.\n\n## 7.

References to Regulatory Requirements  \nThis policy is formulated with reference to and in anticipation of alignment with the following Mongolian legal and regulatory frameworks:\n- The **Law of Mongolia on Central Bank (Bank of Mongolia)**\n- The **Law on Payment and Settlement Systems**\n- The **Securities Market Law**\n- The **Law on Prevention of Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism**\n- The **Civil Code of Mongolia** (regarding obligations and property)\n- Guidance and directives issued by the **Bank of Mongolia** and the **Financial Regulatory Commission**.\n- *Note: Specific amendments or new legislation may be required to fully enact this policy's provisions.*\n\n---\n**Policy Effective Date:** [Date to be determined upon formal adoption]  \n**Issuing Authorities:** Bank of Mongolia & Financial Regulatory Commission of Mongolia\n```"
