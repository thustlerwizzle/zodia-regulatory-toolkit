Based on general regulatory principles for financial services and digital assets, there is a 100% non-compliance status across all critical regulatory domains. The absence of foundational policies for licensing, AML/CFT, and consumer protection constitutes a critical risk, making any operational activity highly vulnerable to immediate regulatory shutdown and legal consequences.

The company lacks any policy addressing licensing requirements, application procedures, or ongoing compliance with BoT's digital currency/electronic money issuer regulations.\n\n**Impact:** Operating without proper authorization could result in enforcement actions, fines, license revocation, criminal liability, and reputational damage.\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Conduct thorough regulatory research to confirm specific licensing requirements from BoT. 2. Develop a licensing application policy and procedure. 3. Establish a regulatory engagement plan with BoT.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (CFT) compliance for digital assets\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found\n\n**Gap:** Tanzania's Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and BoT enforce AML/CFT regulations, which extend to virtual asset service providers (VASPs).

Appoint a designated AML Compliance Officer.\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Draft clear and fair terms of service and risk disclosures. 2. Create a consumer complaint resolution procedure. 3. Develop a policy for regular public reporting on reserve assets (if applicable).\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity standards\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Develop an Information Security Policy and a Cybersecurity Framework. 2. Establish a Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plan. 3. Implement a data protection policy compliant with local laws.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Prudential requirements (e.g., capital adequacy, reserve management)\n\n**Recommendation:** 1.
