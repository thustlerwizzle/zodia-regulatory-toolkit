# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-12T13:07:02.610735

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits a complete absence of stablecoin-specific compliance policies, representing critical regulatory exposure. All fundamental regulatory requirements for stablecoin operations remain unaddressed. Immediate action is required to establish a comprehensive compliance framework before engaging in any stablecoin-related activities. The most critical gaps relate to licensing, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance, which could result in severe regulatory consequences if not addressed promptly. The company should prioritize developing core policies while conducting thorough jurisdictional research on Cook Islands' specific regulatory requirements for digital assets.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance requires licensing/registration with financial regulator

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling
