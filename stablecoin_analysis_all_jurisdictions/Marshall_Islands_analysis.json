Purpose and Scope\n### 2.1 Purpose\nThis policy establishes a comprehensive framework for the management, custody, and verification of reserves backing all [Issuer Name] stablecoins. Its primary purpose is to ensure 100% backing of all outstanding stablecoin tokens with High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA), thereby maintaining stability, fostering user trust, and ensuring strict compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements.\n\n### 2.2 Scope\nThis policy applies to all departments, personnel, and third-party service providers involved in the issuance, redemption, reserve management, custody, auditing, or financial reporting of [Issuer Name] stablecoins. It governs all assets held in reserve for the benefit of stablecoin holders.\n\n## 3. Definitions\n*   **Stablecoin:** A digital asset issued by [Issuer Name] designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified fiat currency (e.g., USD).\n*   **Reserve Assets:** The total pool of assets held to back the value of all outstanding stablecoins.\n*   **High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA):** Assets that are low-risk, readily marketable, and can be easily and immediately converted into cash at little to no loss of value, as further defined in Section 5.1.\n*   **Custodian:** A regulated financial institution or qualified custodian responsible for the safekeeping of Reserve Assets.\n*   **Attestation:** A formal examination and opinion by an independent third-party audit firm regarding the sufficiency and composition of the Reserve Assets.\n*   **Outstanding Stablecoins:** The total number of stablecoin tokens issued and held by the public.\n\n## 4.

At all times, the aggregate value of the Reserve Assets will equal or exceed the aggregate face value of all Outstanding Stablecoins. Reserve Assets will be held in segregated accounts, distinct from the company's operational funds, for the sole benefit of stablecoin holders. Management of these reserves will be conducted with the primary objectives of safety, liquidity, and transparency.\n\n## 5.

Compliance Requirements\n\n### 6.1 Independent Audit and Attestation\n1.  **Frequency:** An independent, third-party certified public accounting firm will perform a monthly attestation on the reserve holdings.\n2.  **Scope:** The attestation report must confirm:\n    *   The value of Reserve Assets equals or exceeds the liability of Outstanding Stablecoins as of the report date.\n    *   The Reserve Assets are composed solely of approved HQLA.\n    *   The assets are held in segregated accounts as described.\n3.  **Publication:** A summary of the attestation report will be made public on the [Issuer Name] website no later than 15 business days after the month-end.\n\n### 6.2 Public Disclosure\nThe following information will be published and updated at least monthly on the company's official website:\n*   The total value of Reserve Assets.\n*   The total number of Outstanding Stablecoins.\n*   The breakdown of Reserve Assets by category (e.g., cash, Treasury bills).\n*   The identity of primary Custodians.\n*   The most recent independent attestation report.\n\n### 6.3 Internal Controls & Monitoring\n1.  **Daily Reconciliation:** The Treasury Department will perform a daily reconciliation of Outstanding Stablecoins (via blockchain ledger) with the aggregate value of Reserve Assets (via custodian statements).\n2.  **Compliance Committee:** A designated committee will review compliance with this policy quarterly, investigate any discrepancies, and approve any material changes to custodians or asset types.\n3.  **Recordkeeping:** All records related to reserve transactions, custodian statements, audit reports, and reconciliations will be retained for a minimum of seven years.\n\n## 7.

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Marshall Islands\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-02-06T01:04:35.995623\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company exhibits a complete absence of documented policies and procedures necessary for stablecoin regulation compliance in the Marshall Islands jurisdiction. All critical regulatory requirements are unmet, representing significant legal, operational, and reputational risks. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive compliance program beginning with licensing strategy, reserve management, and AML/CFT frameworks. The company should engage local legal counsel familiar with MIMA regulations to ensure accurate interpretation of requirements and develop a phased implementation plan addressing critical gaps first.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuer licensing requirement under Marshall Islands Monetary Authority (MIMA) regulations\n\n**Current Status:** No documented licensing policy or application process\n\n**Gap:** Company lacks any policy addressing the need for formal licensing as a stablecoin issuer in the Marshall Islands jurisdiction\n\n**Impact:** Operating without proper licensing could result in regulatory enforcement actions, fines, business suspension, and reputational damage\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop a licensing strategy document outlining the application process, requirements, and timeline for obtaining MIMA approval\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Reserve backing requirements for stablecoins (typically 100% backing with high-quality liquid assets)\n\n**Current Status:** No reserve management policy exists\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policies governing reserve composition, custody, auditing, and transparency\n\n**Impact:** Failure to maintain adequate reserves could lead to stablecoin depegging, loss of consumer confidence, and regulatory sanctions\n\n**Recommendation:** Create a comprehensive reserve management policy specifying asset types, custody arrangements, audit frequency, and public disclosure requirements\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting\n\n**Current Status:** No AML/CFT framework documented\n\n**Gap:** Missing entire anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing program required for financial institutions\n\n**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties, potential criminal liability, and exclusion from banking relationships\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement a full AML/CFT program including KYC procedures, transaction monitoring systems, and SAR reporting protocols\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop consumer protection framework with clear terms of service, redemption procedures, and complaint resolution processes\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Cybersecurity and operational resilience requirements\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish comprehensive cybersecurity policy covering access controls, encryption, incident response, and regular security assessments\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-006\n**Requirement:** Governance and risk management framework\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement a three-lines-of-defense model with clear board oversight, management accountability, and independent compliance function\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **licensing_requirements**: not_met\n❌ **reserve_management**: not_met\n❌ **aml_cft_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **consumer_protection**:
