This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Kenya\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-01-31T06:25:04.731890\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company exhibits significant regulatory compliance gaps across all critical areas for stablecoin operations in Kenya. Current policies are either non-existent or insufficient to meet regulatory expectations. The most critical gaps relate to regulatory authorization, AML/CTF compliance, and consumer protection. Immediate action is required to develop comprehensive compliance frameworks, engage with regulators, and implement necessary controls to avoid severe regulatory consequences. The company is currently non-compliant with Kenyan regulatory requirements and should not operate until these fundamental gaps are addressed.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) requires all digital currency issuers to obtain authorization before operation. The CBK has issued warnings that cryptocurrencies are not legal tender and are not regulated, but stablecoins may fall under payment system regulations.\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy regarding regulatory authorization or licensing requirements for stablecoin operations.\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of licensing framework and regulatory engagement strategy for operating in Kenya.\n\n**Impact:** Risk of regulatory enforcement actions, fines, operational shutdown, and reputational damage for operating without proper authorization.\n\n**Recommendation:** Immediately engage with the Central Bank of Kenya to clarify regulatory status and initiate licensing process. Develop a regulatory engagement strategy document.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance under the Proceeds of Crime and Anti-Money Laundering Act (POCAMLA) and Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs).\n\n**Current Status:** No documented AML/CTF policies, procedures, or controls specific to stablecoin operations.\n\n**Gap:** Missing comprehensive AML/CTF program including customer due diligence (CDD), transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and record-keeping requirements.\n\n**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties, potential criminal liability, loss of banking relationships, and exclusion from financial system.\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop and implement a comprehensive AML/CTF program aligned with POCAMLA and FATF standards, including appointment of a Compliance Officer, risk assessment, and reporting mechanisms.\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection requirements including clear disclosure of risks, terms of service, and redemption mechanisms for stablecoin holders.\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive consumer protection framework including clear disclosures, terms of service, complaint handling procedures, and redemption policy documentation.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Capital adequacy and reserve requirements for stablecoin issuers to ensure 1:1 backing and redemption capability.\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish reserve management policy with clear custody arrangements, regular independent audits, and transparent reporting on reserve composition and adequacy.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Data protection and privacy compliance under Kenya's Data Protection Act, 2019.\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop and implement comprehensive data protection program aligned with Kenya's Data Protection Act, including appointment of Data Protection Officer and privacy impact assessments.\n\n### Gap 4: GAP-006\n**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity requirements for financial service providers.\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish enterprise risk management framework with specific focus on operational risks, cybersecurity controls, and business continuity planning.\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **regulatory_authorization**: not_met\n❌ **aml_ctf_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **consumer_protection**: not_met\n❌ **capital_reserve_requirements**: not_met\n❌ **data_protection**: not_met\n❌ **operational_risk_management**: not_met\n❌ **tax_compliance**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update Summary\nGenerated: 2026-01-31T06:55:04.701104\n\n## Overview\nThis document summarizes proposed updates to company policies and standards based on regulatory gap analysis.\n\n## New Policies Required\n\n## Modified Policies\n\n### GAP-001\n**Category:** Legal\n**Current Policy:** No documented policy regarding regulatory authorization or licensing requirements for stablecoin operations.\n**Proposed Change:** Immediately engage with the Central Bank of Kenya to clarify regulatory status and initiate licensing process.
