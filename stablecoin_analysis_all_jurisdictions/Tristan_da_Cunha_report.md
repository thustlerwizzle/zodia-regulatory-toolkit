# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-12T13:57:34.089415

## Executive Summary
Overall compliance status is NON-COMPLIANT. The company currently lacks any documented policies addressing the core regulatory pillars for stablecoin issuance and operation. This represents an extreme level of regulatory, financial, and reputational risk. Immediate and comprehensive action is required to develop and implement a full suite of compliance policies and controls before conducting any further stablecoin-related business. The foundational gaps (GAP-001, GAP-002) concerning reserves and AML are of the highest critical priority, as failures here could lead to immediate regulatory shutdown and legal consequences.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must maintain 1:1 reserves in high-quality liquid assets (typically cash or cash equivalents) to back all issued stablecoins.

**Current Status:** No documented policy on reserve requirements or asset backing.

**Gap:** Complete absence of reserve management framework, custody arrangements, or asset verification procedures.

**Impact:** Risk of regulatory enforcement, loss of consumer trust, potential insolvency if redemption demands exceed reserves, and legal liability for misrepresentation.

**Recommendation:** Develop and implement a comprehensive Reserve Management Policy specifying: 1) Acceptable reserve assets (e.g., cash, short-term government securities), 2) Custody arrangements with qualified custodians, 3) Monthly independent attestations or audits of reserves, 4) Public disclosure of reserve composition.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must implement robust Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF), and Know Your Customer (KYC) programs for all transactions and wallet holders.

**Current Status:** No AML/CTF or KYC policy documented.

**Gap:** No framework for customer identification, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, or sanctions screening.

**Impact:** Severe risk of facilitating illicit finance, leading to regulatory sanctions, fines, loss of banking relationships, and criminal prosecution.

**Recommendation:** Immediately draft and adopt a Financial Crime Compliance Program. This must include: 1) Risk-based KYC/CDD procedures for all users, 2) Transaction monitoring systems, 3) Procedures for filing Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs), 4) Regular employee training, and 5) Appointment of a designated Compliance Officer.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Issuers must provide clear, accurate, and regular disclosures to the public and regulators regarding the stablecoin's operation, risks, and reserve status.

**Recommendation:** Create a Transparency and Disclosure Policy mandating: 1) Publicly accessible terms of service outlining redemption rights and risks, 2) Monthly publication of reserve attestation reports, 3) Clear communication of the stablecoin's governance and operational mechanics.

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** A secure and reliable redemption mechanism must be in place, allowing holders to redeem stablecoins for the referenced fiat currency at par value within a reasonable timeframe.

**Recommendation:** Establish a formal Redemption Process Policy detailing: 1) User verification steps for redemption, 2) Approved methods for fiat disbursement, 3) Maximum processing timeframes (e.g., T+2 business days), 4) Fee structure (if any), and 5) Contingency plans for high-volume redemption events.

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Issuers must have comprehensive risk management frameworks covering operational, cybersecurity, liquidity, and market risks.

**Recommendation:** Develop an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework. Key components should include: 1) A dedicated Risk Committee, 2) Regular risk assessments (cyber, operational, liquidity), 3) A tested Incident Response and Business Continuity Plan, 4) Specific liquidity risk management for the reserve portfolio.
