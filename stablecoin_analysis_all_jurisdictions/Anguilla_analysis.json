Policy Title\nAnti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) Policy for Digital Asset Operations, with Specific Focus on Stablecoin Activities\n\n## 2. Purpose and Scope\n### Purpose\nThis policy establishes a comprehensive framework to detect, prevent, and report money laundering (ML) and terrorist financing (TF) risks associated with stablecoin operations. It is designed to ensure full compliance with Anguilla’s Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA) and Anti-Money Laundering Regulations (AMLR), and to protect the institution from being used for illicit financial activities.\n\n### Scope\nThis policy applies to all employees, contractors, directors, and agents of [Company Name] involved in:\n- The issuance, redemption, exchange, transfer, or custody of stablecoins.\n- All fiat-to-stablecoin and stablecoin-to-stablecoin transactions.\n- Customer onboarding and ongoing due diligence.\n- Transaction monitoring and reporting.\n- The development and oversight of related products and services.\n\n## 3. Definitions\n- **Beneficial Owner**: The natural person(s) who ultimately owns or controls a customer, or the person on whose behalf a transaction is conducted.\n- **Customer Due Diligence (CDD)**: The process of identifying and verifying the customer and beneficial owner.\n- **Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD)**: Enhanced measures to manage and mitigate higher ML/TF risks.\n- **FSC**: The Financial Services Commission of Anguilla, the primary regulatory authority.\n- **POCA**: The Proceeds of Crime Act of Anguilla.\n- **AMLR**: The Anti-Money Laundering Regulations of Anguilla.\n- **SAR**: Suspicious Activity Report.\n- **Stablecoin**: A type of digital asset designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified asset or pool of assets (e.g., fiat currency).\n- **Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP)**: Any natural or legal person conducting specified activities, including exchange, transfer, and custody of virtual assets.\n\n## 4.

Procedures\n\n### 5.1 Risk Assessment Methodology\n- **Enterprise-Wide Risk Assessment (EWRA):** Conduct a documented EWRA annually, evaluating ML/TF risks associated with customers, geographies, products (especially stablecoin types), services, channels, and technologies.\n- **Risk Factors:** Consider volume, anonymity, complexity, and jurisdictional risks. Stablecoins pegged to high-risk fiat currencies or backed by opaque reserves will be deemed higher risk.\n- **Risk Rating:** Assign an overall risk rating (Low, Medium, High) to the business and apply a risk-based approach (RBA) to all subsequent controls.\n\n### 5.2 Tiered KYC/CDD Procedures\n- **Standard CDD (All Customers):**\n    - Identify and verify the customer's identity (name, DOB, address, national ID/passport).\n    - Identify and verify the Beneficial Owner (for legal entities).\n    - Understand the nature and intended purpose of the business relationship.\n    - Conduct ongoing due diligence and scrutiny of transactions.\n- **Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) for High-Risk:** Applied to customers from high-risk jurisdictions, Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs), complex or unusual transaction patterns, and certain stablecoin transactions above defined thresholds. EDD includes:\n    - Obtaining additional identifying information.\n    - Securing senior management approval for establishing/continuing the relationship.\n    - Requiring the first payment to be made from an account in the customer's name at a regulated bank.\n    - Increasing the frequency of ongoing due diligence reviews.\n- **Simplified Due Diligence (SDD):** May be applied only in strictly justified low-risk scenarios, in line with AMLR provisions, and is generally not applicable for most stablecoin transactions.\n\n### 5.3 Transaction Monitoring & Blockchain Analysis\n- **Automated Monitoring System:** Implement a system to monitor customer transactions for unusual or suspicious patterns, with rules calibrated to stablecoin activity.\n- **Key Indicators:** Large, rapid, or round-number stablecoin transfers; structuring; transactions with high-risk VASPs or wallet addresses (e.g., darknet markets, mixers); inconsistent activity with customer profile.\n- **Blockchain Analytics:** Utilize blockchain analysis tools to screen wallet addresses for links to illicit activity, sanctions lists, and known fraudulent schemes. All counterparty addresses will be screened prior to processing transactions.\n- **Record Keeping:** All transaction records and monitoring alerts must be maintained for at least seven (7) years from the date of the transaction or the end of the business relationship, as required by law.\n\n### 5.4 Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR) & FSC Protocols\n- **Internal Reporting:** Any employee who suspects an activity is related to ML/TF must immediately file an internal report with the Compliance Officer (CO) / Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO).\n- **MLRO Review:** The MLRO will independently assess the internal report. If suspicion remains, a formal SAR will be filed.\n- **FSC Reporting:** SARs will be filed electronically with the FSC’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) without delay, and no later than 3 business days after forming the suspicion, per POCA requirements.\n- **Tipping-Off Prohibition:** Strict confidentiality must be maintained. No person shall disclose (\"tip-off\") that an SAR has been filed or that an investigation is underway.\n\n### 5.5 Employee Training Program\n- **Mandatory Training:** All relevant employees must complete initial and annual AML/CFT training.\n- **Curriculum:** Training will cover POCA/AMLR obligations, this policy, KYC/CDD/EDD procedures, red flag indicators for stablecoins, SAR procedures, and tipping-off prohibitions.\n- **Role-Specific Training:** Tailored training will be provided for compliance staff, front-line personnel, and senior management.\n- **Records:** Completion records will be maintained for audit and regulatory review.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n- The Board of Directors holds ultimate responsibility for AML/CFT compliance.\n- A designated MLRO/Compliance Officer is appointed with full authority, independence, and resources to implement this policy.\n- Independent audit function will test the effectiveness of the AML/CFT program at least biennially.\n- Failure by any employee to comply with this policy will result in disciplinary action.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule\nThis policy shall be reviewed and updated:\n- **Annually,** as part of the EWRA process.\n- **Immediately,** following any material changes in regulatory requirements, business operations, or ML/TF risk profile.\n- **At least every two years,** as part of the independent audit cycle.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements\nThis policy is formulated to ensure compliance with, but not limited to, the following Anguillian legislation and guidance:\n- Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA) (Revised Statutes of Anguilla, Chapter P90)\n- Anti-Money Laundering Regulations (AMLR)\n- Guidance Notes issued by the Financial Services Commission (FSC) of Anguilla\n- International standards set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Recommendations\n\n---\n**Policy Version:** 1.0  \n**Effective Date:** [Date]  \n**Approved By:** [Name, Title of Approver]  \n**Next Scheduled Review:** [Date, One Year from Effective Date]\n```"

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Anguilla\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-02-12T13:26:21.907466\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company exhibits a complete absence of documented policies for stablecoin operations in Anguilla, representing critical non-compliance with fundamental regulatory requirements. All seven identified regulatory areas are currently not met. Immediate action is required to develop comprehensive policies and initiate licensing applications before commencing operations. The most critical gaps involve licensing, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance, which could result in severe regulatory sanctions and business prohibition if not addressed urgently. A phased implementation approach is recommended, starting with critical priorities while developing the full compliance framework.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must be licensed or registered with Anguilla's Financial Services Commission (FSC) under the Financial Services Commission Act and related regulations.\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy for regulatory registration or licensing in Anguilla.\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policy addressing mandatory licensing/registration requirements for stablecoin operations in Anguilla.\n\n**Impact:** Operating without required license could result in enforcement actions, fines, business suspension, reputational damage, and potential criminal liability.\n\n**Recommendation:** Immediately initiate FSC licensing application process. Develop comprehensive licensing policy covering application requirements, ongoing compliance, and reporting obligations.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must maintain adequate reserves (typically 100% backing) with qualified custodians and undergo regular independent audits.\n\n**Current Status:** No documented reserve management or audit policy.\n\n**Gap:** Missing policies for reserve composition, custody arrangements, audit frequency, and transparency reporting.\n\n**Impact:** Failure to maintain adequate reserves could lead to insolvency, loss of consumer funds, regulatory sanctions, and loss of market confidence.\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop Reserve Management Policy specifying: 1) Composition of reserves (cash, cash equivalents, government securities), 2) Custodian selection criteria, 3) Monthly reserve attestations, 4) Quarterly independent audits, 5) Public disclosure framework.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance under Anguilla's Proceeds of Crime Act and Anti-Money Laundering Regulations, including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting.\n\n**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT policy specific to stablecoin operations.\n\n**Gap:** Lack of risk-based AML/CFT program tailored to stablecoin transactions, including KYC, transaction monitoring, and SAR procedures.\n\n**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties, loss of banking relationships, potential criminal liability for money laundering offenses.\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive AML/CFT Policy including: 1) Risk assessment methodology, 2) Tiered KYC procedures, 3) Transaction monitoring rules for blockchain analysis, 4) SAR procedures with FSC reporting protocols, 5) Employee training program.\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection requirements including clear disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling procedures.\n\n**Recommendation:** Create Consumer Protection Policy covering: 1) Clear terms of service, 2) Fee transparency, 3) Redemption procedures and timelines, 4) Complaint handling with escalation procedures, 5) User education materials.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Cybersecurity and operational resilience requirements for digital asset service providers.\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop Cybersecurity Policy including: 1) Multi-signature wallet protocols, 2) Cold storage procedures, 3) Incident response plan, 4) Regular penetration testing, 5) Business continuity and disaster recovery plans.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-006\n**Requirement:** Regular reporting to FSC including financial statements, compliance reports, and significant incident notifications.\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish Regulatory Reporting Policy specifying: 1) Reporting calendar with deadlines, 2) Report templates and content requirements, 3) Review and approval workflow, 4) Record retention procedures, 5) Designated compliance officer responsibilities.\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **licensing_registration**: not_met\n❌ **reserve_requirements**: not_met\n❌ **aml_cft_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **consumer_protection**: not_met\n❌ **cybersecurity**: not_met\n❌ **regulatory_reporting**: not_met\n❌ **governance_standards**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update Summary\nGenerated: 2026-02-12T13:27:02.857608\n\n## Overview\nThis document summarizes proposed updates to company policies and standards based on regulatory gap analysis.\n\n## New Policies Required\n\n## Modified Policies\n\n### GAP-001\n**Category:** Compliance\n**Current Policy:** No documented policy for regulatory registration or licensing in Anguilla.\n**Proposed Change:** Immediately initiate FSC licensing application process.
