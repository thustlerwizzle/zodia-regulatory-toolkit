This includes, but is not limited to:\n- Smart contract code and blockchain nodes\n- Key management systems and wallets\n- Transaction processing and validation systems\n- Administrative and operational platforms\n- Data storage and communication networks\n\n## 3. Definitions  \n- **Stablecoin Infrastructure:** The ensemble of technological systems, smart contracts, protocols, and operational processes that enable the issuance, redemption, transfer, and governance of the stablecoin.\n- **Secure Key Management:** The full lifecycle management of cryptographic keys (generation, storage, distribution, rotation, revocation, and destruction) using industry-standard hardware security modules (HSMs) or equivalent.\n- **Smart Contract Auditing:** A formal, independent review of smart contract code to identify security vulnerabilities, logical flaws, and compliance with specifications prior to deployment.\n- **Penetration Testing:** Authorized simulated cyberattacks on the infrastructure to evaluate the security of the system and identify exploitable vulnerabilities.\n- **Incident Response Plan (IRP):** A documented, structured approach for detecting, responding to, and recovering from cybersecurity incidents.\n- **Disaster Recovery (DR) Protocols:** Procedures and technical measures to restore critical systems, data, and operations following a significant disruptive event.\n- **Critical Systems:** Any system whose failure or compromise would materially impact the stability, redeemability, or security of the stablecoin.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement  \nIt is the policy of this organization to ensure the highest practicable level of cybersecurity and operational resilience for its stablecoin infrastructure. We commit to:\n- Proactively identifying, assessing, and mitigating cybersecurity risks.\n- Implementing defense-in-depth security controls aligned with industry best practices (e.g., NIST CSF, ISO 27001).\n- Ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all critical systems and data.\n- Maintaining robust capabilities to respond to and recover from security incidents and operational disruptions.\n- Complying with all applicable regulatory requirements related to cybersecurity and operational resilience for digital assets.\n\n## 5. Procedures  \nTo implement this policy, the following mandatory procedures shall be established and maintained:\n\n**A. Secure Key Management Procedures**\n1. All cryptographic keys for foundation, operational, and user wallets must be generated and stored in FIPS 140-2 Level 3 (or higher) validated HSMs or equivalent secure, air-gapped environments.\n2. A strict principle of least privilege and separation of duties (multi-signature schemes) shall govern key access and usage.\n3. Key generation, backup, rotation, and revocation schedules must be documented and executed automatically where possible.\n4. Private keys must never be exposed in plaintext outside of secure cryptographic hardware.\n\n**B. Smart Contract Auditing**\n1. All smart contract code must undergo a full security audit by at least one independent, reputable third-party auditing firm prior to deployment on any mainnet or production environment.\n2. Audit findings must be remediated, and the final audit report must be approved by the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and Legal/Compliance.\n3. A re-audit is required for any material change to audited contract code.\n\n**C. Penetration Testing**\n1. External penetration tests of the entire stablecoin infrastructure (including web interfaces, APIs, and backend systems) must be conducted at least annually, or after any significant architectural change.\n2. Tests must be performed by a qualified independent third party.\n3. All critical and high-severity vulnerabilities identified must be remediated within predefined, risk-based timelines.\n\n**D. Incident Response Plan (IRP)**\n1. A formal IRP shall be documented, detailing roles, responsibilities, communication protocols, and steps for identification, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident analysis.\n2. The IRP must include specific playbooks for scenarios such as private key compromise, smart contract exploit, and denial-of-service attacks.\n3. Incident response teams shall conduct tabletop exercises simulating major incidents at least semi-annually.\n\n**E. Disaster Recovery (DR) Protocols**\n1. A Business Impact Analysis (BIA) shall identify Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) for all critical systems.\n2. Geographically redundant, secure backups of all critical data (including blockchain state and key material backups) must be maintained and tested regularly.\n3. Full-scale disaster recovery tests, simulating the loss of a primary data center or critical service, must be executed at least annually.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements  \n- All personnel and third-party providers with access to critical systems are required to acknowledge and adhere to this policy and its associated procedures.\n- The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) is responsible for monitoring compliance.\n- Non-compliance will result in corrective action, which may include access revocation, disciplinary action, or termination of third-party contracts.\n- Evidence of compliance (audit reports, test results, exercise reports) must be maintained for regulatory examination.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule  \nThis policy and all associated procedures shall be reviewed and updated:\n- **Annually** as part of the standard policy review cycle.\n- **Immediately** following a significant security incident.\n- **Upon issuance of new or revised regulatory guidance** pertaining to stablecoin or digital asset cybersecurity.\n- **After any major change** to the stablecoin infrastructure or threat landscape.\n\nAll updates require approval from the Policy Steering Committee (comprising representatives from Technology, Security, Risk, Legal, and Compliance).\n\n## 8.

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Laos\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-01-31T10:57:15.928985\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company exhibits a complete lack of compliance with stablecoin regulatory requirements in Laos. No policies were identified addressing any aspect of stablecoin operations, indicating either that operations have not commenced or that they are proceeding without any regulatory compliance framework. All identified gaps are rated as critical or high priority due to the severe regulatory, financial, and reputational risks involved. Immediate action is required to assess the regulatory landscape in Laos, potentially suspend operations until compliance can be established, and develop comprehensive policies across all regulatory domains. Given the limited regulatory research results, engaging local legal counsel in Laos is essential to obtain accurate, current regulatory requirements specific to the Laotian jurisdiction.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Legal framework for stablecoin issuance and operation in Laos\n\n**Current Status:** No company policies identified for stablecoin operations\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing stablecoin regulatory requirements in Laos.
