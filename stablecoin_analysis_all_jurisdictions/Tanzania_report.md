# Gap Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
The company's current policies present a complete void against the anticipated regulatory landscape for stablecoins in Tanzania. Based on general regulatory principles for financial services and digital assets, there is a 100% non-compliance status across all critical regulatory domains. The absence of foundational policies for licensing, AML/CFT, and consumer protection constitutes a critical risk, making any operational activity highly vulnerable to immediate regulatory shutdown and legal consequences. The highest priority must be given to understanding the precise regulatory position of the Bank of Tanzania and building a compliance framework from the ground up before any market entry or operational launch.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Authorization/Licensing for stablecoin issuance and operation in Tanzania

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** Tanzania's regulatory framework likely requires authorization from the Bank of Tanzania (BoT) for issuing or operating stablecoin services. The company lacks any policy addressing licensing requirements, application procedures, or ongoing compliance with BoT's digital currency/electronic money issuer regulations.

**Impact:** Operating without proper authorization could result in enforcement actions, fines, license revocation, criminal liability, and reputational damage.

**Recommendation:** 1. Conduct thorough regulatory research to confirm specific licensing requirements from BoT. 2. Develop a licensing application policy and procedure. 3. Establish a regulatory engagement plan with BoT.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (CFT) compliance for digital assets

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** Tanzania's Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and BoT enforce AML/CFT regulations, which extend to virtual asset service providers (VASPs). The company lacks policies for Customer Due Diligence (CDD), Know Your Customer (KYC), transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting (SAR), and record-keeping specific to stablecoin transactions.

**Impact:** High risk of facilitating financial crime, leading to severe regulatory penalties, loss of banking relationships, and potential criminal prosecution.

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop a comprehensive AML/CFT program tailored to stablecoin operations. 2. Implement KYC/CDD procedures for all users. 3. Establish transaction monitoring and SAR filing protocols. 4. Appoint a designated AML Compliance Officer.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements

**Recommendation:** 1. Draft clear and fair terms of service and risk disclosures. 2. Create a consumer complaint resolution procedure. 3. Develop a policy for regular public reporting on reserve assets (if applicable).

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity standards

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop an Information Security Policy and a Cybersecurity Framework. 2. Establish a Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plan. 3. Implement a data protection policy compliant with local laws.

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Prudential requirements (e.g., capital adequacy, reserve management)

**Recommendation:** 1. Determine applicable prudential rules from BoT. 2. Develop a Capital Adequacy and Reserve Management Policy. 3. Establish procedures for independent audit of reserves.
