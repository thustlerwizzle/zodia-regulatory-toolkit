# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-07T10:36:01.288782

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits a complete lack of policies addressing Greenland's stablecoin regulatory requirements. All core regulatory areas show 'not_met' status, indicating significant compliance risk. Immediate action is required to develop comprehensive policies, particularly for regulatory authorization, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance. Given Greenland's likely alignment with EU/EEA financial regulations, the company should prepare for stringent oversight requirements. The absence of any documented policies suggests the company is not operationally ready for stablecoin issuance in regulated jurisdictions.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance requires authorization from Greenland's financial regulator (likely under Danish/Greenlandic financial supervision framework)

**Current Status:** No documented policy for stablecoin issuance or regulatory authorization process

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing regulatory authorization requirements for issuing stablecoins in Greenland

**Impact:** Potential regulatory enforcement actions, fines, prohibition of operations, and reputational damage

**Recommendation:** Develop a comprehensive regulatory authorization policy including: 1) Application process for regulatory approval, 2) Documentation requirements, 3) Engagement protocol with Greenlandic/Danish financial authorities, 4) Timeline and milestone tracking

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must maintain adequate reserves (likely following EU/EEA standards for e-money or payment services)

**Current Status:** No reserve management or asset backing policies documented

**Gap:** Missing policies governing reserve composition, custody, auditing, and transparency requirements

**Impact:** Risk of insolvency, loss of peg, regulatory sanctions, and loss of consumer trust

**Recommendation:** Create reserve management policy specifying: 1) Eligible reserve assets, 2) Custody arrangements, 3) Regular auditing requirements, 4) Public disclosure framework, 5) Liquidity management procedures

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance for stablecoin transactions (following Greenland's implementation of EU AML directives)

**Current Status:** No specific AML/CFT policies for stablecoin operations

**Gap:** Lack of transaction monitoring, customer due diligence, and suspicious activity reporting procedures tailored to stablecoin activities

**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties, potential criminal liability, and exclusion from financial systems

**Recommendation:** Develop stablecoin-specific AML/CFT policy including: 1) Risk-based customer verification, 2) Transaction monitoring thresholds, 3) Reporting procedures to Greenlandic Financial Intelligence Unit, 4) Record-keeping requirements

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including redemption rights and disclosures

**Recommendation:** Implement consumer protection policy covering: 1) Redemption procedures and timelines, 2) Fee disclosure requirements, 3) Complaint handling process, 4) Terms of service transparency

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity requirements

**Recommendation:** Establish operational risk framework including: 1) Smart contract security protocols, 2) Private key management procedures, 3) Business continuity planning, 4) Incident response plan, 5) Regular security audits
