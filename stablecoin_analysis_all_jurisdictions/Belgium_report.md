# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T18:50:28.334193

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no documented policies addressing Belgian/EU stablecoin regulations. All fundamental regulatory requirements are unmet, creating severe legal, operational, and reputational risks. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive regulatory compliance framework before any stablecoin operations can commence in Belgium. The most critical gaps requiring immediate attention are authorization requirements, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance. Without addressing these foundational gaps, the company cannot legally operate in the Belgian market and faces significant regulatory enforcement risks.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Authorization as a payment institution or electronic money institution for stablecoin issuance in Belgium (under EU-wide frameworks like MiCA - Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation)

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing authorization requirements for stablecoin issuance or provision of crypto-asset services in Belgium/EU

**Impact:** Legal prohibition from operating, severe regulatory penalties, potential criminal liability for unauthorized financial services

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive authorization framework policy outlining requirements under MiCA and Belgian financial regulations, including application procedures, capital requirements, and governance standards

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Stablecoin reserve requirements (full backing with high-quality liquid assets, segregation of funds, regular independent audits)

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** No policies governing reserve management, asset segregation, or audit requirements for stablecoin backing

**Impact:** Risk of insolvency, loss of consumer funds, regulatory enforcement actions, loss of market confidence

**Recommendation:** Create detailed reserve management policy specifying eligible assets, custody arrangements, segregation requirements, and audit frequency in line with MiCA Article 36-38

### Gap 3: GAP-004
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance (customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, reporting obligations under Belgian AML law)

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** Complete absence of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing policies required for crypto-asset service providers

**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, potential criminal prosecution, loss of banking relationships, inclusion in blacklists

**Recommendation:** Develop and implement full AML/CFT program aligned with Belgian Financial Intelligence Processing Unit (CTIF-CFI) requirements and EU AML directives

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures (transparency requirements, redemption rights, complaint handling)

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive consumer protection policy covering whitepaper requirements, redemption procedures, fee transparency, and complaint resolution mechanisms

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity requirements

**Recommendation:** Establish operational resilience framework covering cybersecurity standards, business continuity planning, and incident response procedures

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Governance and risk management framework

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive governance policy covering board composition, risk management framework, internal controls, and compliance monitoring
