For legal entities, this includes identifying and verifying beneficial owners owning 10% or more.\n4.  **Due Diligence Levels:**\n    *   **Standard CDD:** Applied to medium-risk customers. Includes identification, verification, and understanding the nature of the business relationship.\n    *   **Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD):** Mandatory for high-risk customers (e.g., PEPs, high-risk countries, complex legal structures). Includes obtaining senior management approval, understanding source of wealth/funds, and conducting enhanced ongoing monitoring.\n    *   **Simplified Due Diligence (SDD):** May be applied to low-risk customers where permitted by law, with documented justification.\n\n### 5.2 Ongoing Transaction Monitoring\n1.  **Automated System:** The Organization will implement and maintain an automated transaction monitoring system calibrated to detect patterns of activity indicative of ML/TF.\n2.  **Monitoring Parameters:** The system will flag transactions based on predefined rules and scenarios (e.g., structuring, unusual high-value transactions, activity inconsistent with customer profile).\n3.  **Alert Review:** Designated compliance personnel will investigate all system-generated alerts. A clear audit trail of the review and resolution will be maintained.\n\n### 5.3 Designated Compliance Officer (MLRO)\n1.  **Appointment:** A qualified Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO) will be appointed with sufficient authority, independence, and resources.\n2.  **Responsibilities:** The MLRO is responsible for the day-to-day oversight of the AML/CFT program, receiving internal reports of suspicious activity, making SAR filing decisions, acting as the primary contact with regulators, and ensuring staff training.\n\n### 5.4 Staff Training\n1.  **Regular Training:** All relevant personnel shall receive annual AML/CFT training upon hiring and periodically thereafter.\n2.  **Content:** Training will cover regulatory requirements, the Organization's policies and procedures, red flag indicators, and their personal obligations for reporting suspicious activity.\n3.  **Records:** Attendance and content of all training sessions will be documented.\n\n### 5.5 Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR)\n1.  **Internal Reporting:** Any employee who suspects or has reasonable grounds to suspect a transaction involves proceeds of crime or is related to TF must immediately report to the MLRO via a secure internal report.\n2.  **MLRO Assessment:** The MLRO will conduct an independent review of the internal report and all relevant information.\n3.  **External Filing:** If the MLRO determines there are reasonable grounds for suspicion, a SAR will be filed with the relevant FIU within mandated timelines without tipping off the subject.\n4.  **\"Tipping-Off\" Prohibition:** Strict confidentiality must be maintained. Disclosing that a SAR has been filed or is under consideration is prohibited.\n\n## 6.

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Melilla\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-02-12T17:54:17.645995\n\n## Executive Summary\nCRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company appears to have no documented policies addressing fundamental regulatory requirements for stablecoin operations in EU/Spanish jurisdiction (including Melilla). This represents an existential risk to the business, with immediate regulatory intervention likely if operations commence without remediation. All identified regulatory requirements are currently not met. Immediate action is required on licensing strategy, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance before any customer operations can be considered. The company should suspend any customer-facing activities until critical gaps are addressed and engage specialized legal and compliance expertise immediately.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must maintain 1:1 reserves in high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) with regular independent audits\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy on reserve management or audit requirements\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of reserve management framework, custody arrangements, or audit protocols\n\n**Impact:** Regulatory enforcement action, license revocation, financial penalties, loss of customer trust, potential insolvency risk\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive reserve management policy specifying: 1) Eligible asset classes (cash, government securities, etc.), 2) Custody arrangements with regulated institutions, 3) Monthly attestations and quarterly independent audits, 4) Public disclosure of reserve composition\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance including customer due diligence (CDD), transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting\n\n**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT program\n\n**Gap:** Missing entire AML/CFT framework required for financial institutions operating in EU/Spanish jurisdiction\n\n**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, criminal liability for executives, inability to access banking services, reputational damage\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement full AML/CFT program including: 1) Risk-based customer identification and verification, 2) Ongoing transaction monitoring system, 3) Designated compliance officer, 4) Regular staff training, 5) Suspicious activity reporting procedures\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Licensing/registration with relevant authorities (potentially Bank of Spain/CNMV for Spanish territory including Melilla)\n\n**Current Status:** No documented licensing strategy or regulatory engagement plan\n\n**Gap:** Unclear regulatory status and lack of engagement with supervisory authorities\n\n**Impact:** Operating illegally, immediate shutdown orders, criminal prosecution of executives, asset seizure\n\n**Recommendation:** Immediately: 1) Determine applicable licensing regime (MiCA, Spanish payment services regulations), 2) Engage legal counsel specialized in Spanish/EU financial regulation, 3) Prepare licensing application, 4) Establish dialogue with Bank of Spain/CNMV\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including clear disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling\n\n**Recommendation:** Create consumer protection framework with: 1) Clear risk disclosures in plain language, 2) Guaranteed redemption procedures with defined timelines, 3) Dedicated complaint handling process, 4) Compensation scheme or insurance arrangements\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity requirements for payment systems\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop operational resilience framework including: 1) Business continuity and disaster recovery plans, 2) Cybersecurity controls aligned with NIST/ISO standards, 3) Incident response procedures, 4) Regular penetration testing and security audits\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-006\n**Requirement:** Governance requirements including fit and proper assessments of management, board oversight, and risk management framework\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish governance framework including: 1) Board composition with independent members, 2) Risk management committee, 3) Fit and proper assessments for directors/senior management, 4) Three lines of defense model\n\n### Gap 4: GAP-007\n**Requirement:** Data protection compliance (GDPR) for EU territories including Melilla\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement GDPR compliance program including: 1) Data protection officer appointment, 2) Data processing agreements, 3) Privacy notices and consent mechanisms, 4) Data subject rights procedures, 5) Data breach notification protocols\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **reserve_requirements**: not_met\n❌ **aml_cft_compliance**: not_met\n❌
