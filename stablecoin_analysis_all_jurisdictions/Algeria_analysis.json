Policy Title\nGeographic Restrictions Policy Prohibiting Stablecoin Services in Algeria\n\n## 2. Purpose and Scope\n### 2.1 Purpose\nThis policy establishes clear and enforceable restrictions to ensure that the organization does not offer, market, sell, or facilitate any stablecoin-related services to residents or entities within the People’s Democratic Republic of Algeria (\"Algeria\"). This is a direct response to the absence of legal authorization or a regulatory framework for issuing or operating stablecoins in Algeria, thereby mitigating legal, regulatory, and reputational risks for the organization.\n\n### 2.2 Scope\nThis policy applies globally to:\n*   All employees, contractors, consultants, and temporary staff of the organization.\n*   All subsidiaries, affiliates, and partners acting on the organization's behalf.\n*   All products, services, websites, applications, and platforms owned or operated by the organization that involve stablecoins (digital assets designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified asset or pool of assets).\n*   All stages of customer interaction, including marketing, onboarding, transaction processing, and support.\n\n## 3. Definitions\n| Term | Definition |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Algerian Resident** | Any individual physically located in Algeria, or any entity (including corporations, partnerships, and organizations) incorporated, domiciled, or operating primarily within Algeria. |\n| **Geoblocking** | The use of technical measures to restrict access to digital services based on the user's geographical location, typically determined by IP address. |\n| **IP Address** | A unique numerical label assigned to a device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. |\n| **KYC (Know Your Customer)** | The process of verifying the identity of clients and assessing their suitability, along with potential risks of illegal intentions for the business relationship. |\n| **Onboarding** | The process through which a new customer applies for, and is granted, access to the organization's services. |\n| **Stablecoin Services** | Any activity involving the issuance, exchange, transfer, custody, marketing, sale, or facilitation of transactions using stablecoins. |\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\nIt is the policy of [Organization Name] to strictly prohibit the deliberate provision of any Stablecoin Services to Algerian Residents or entities. Due to the lack of a legal and regulatory framework authorizing stablecoin activities in Algeria, the organization will not engage with this jurisdiction. Any known or suspected provision of services to Algeria is a violation of this policy and may result in disciplinary action.\n\n## 5. Procedures\nTo enforce this policy, the following technical and operational procedures must be implemented:\n\n### 5.1 IP-Based Geoblocking\n*   The Technology Department shall implement and maintain robust IP address geoblocking on all customer-facing platforms (websites, APIs, mobile applications).\n*   This system must actively prevent users with IP addresses geolocated to Algeria from:\n    *   Accessing service registration/login pages.\n    *   Viewing marketing materials related to stablecoin services.\n    *   Downloading relevant applications from official stores.\n*   A block page must be displayed, stating that services are not available in the user's jurisdiction.\n\n### 5.2 Customer Onboarding & Ongoing Due Diligence\n*   The Compliance Department shall integrate Algerian jurisdiction checks into the KYC and customer onboarding workflow.\n*   **Proof of Address:** Required documentation for address verification (e.g., utility bill, bank statement) must be screened. Any document indicating an Algerian address must trigger an immediate application rejection.\n*   **Self-Declaration:** The onboarding application must include a mandatory declaration where the applicant confirms they are not a resident of any prohibited jurisdiction, including Algeria.\n*   **Ongoing Monitoring:** Periodic re-screening of customer profiles must be conducted to identify any customers who may have relocated to Algeria.\n\n### 5.3 Marketing & Business Development Restrictions\n*   The Marketing and Sales Departments are prohibited from targeting Algerian Residents with any promotional materials, advertisements, or communications related to stablecoin services.\n*   Digital marketing campaigns must use geo-targeting tools to explicitly exclude Algeria from all ad buys and social media promotions.\n*   Business development teams shall not pursue partnerships with entities known to be primarily serving the Algerian market.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n### 6.1 Employee Acknowledgment\nAll relevant personnel must complete training on this policy upon its implementation and annually thereafter. Acknowledgment of understanding and adherence is mandatory.\n\n### 6.2 Breach Reporting\nAny employee who identifies a potential breach of this policy (e.g., a customer suspected to be in Algeria, a technical failure in geoblocking) must immediately report it to their manager and the Compliance Department.\n\n### 6.3 Audit & Testing\nThe Internal Audit or Compliance Department will conduct quarterly tests to verify the effectiveness of the geoblocking controls and the accuracy of the onboarding checks. Findings will be documented and remediated.\n\n### 6.4 Consequences for Violation\nViolations of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contractual relationships. Service to any customer identified as an Algerian Resident will be terminated immediately.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule\nThis policy shall be reviewed **annually** by the Policy Owner (Legal & Compliance Department). Reviews will:\n*   Assess the effectiveness of controls.\n*   Evaluate changes in the regulatory landscape in Algeria.\n*   Incorporate technological advancements in geolocation and verification.\n*   Update procedures as necessary.\n\nAny major change in Algerian regulation regarding stablecoins will trigger an immediate, out-of-cycle review.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements\nThis policy is predicated on the following regulatory analysis:\n*   **Primary Reference:** The absence of explicit legal authorization for the issuance or operation of stablecoins under Algerian financial, banking, or payments regulations, including but not limited to:\n    *   Algerian Financial and Monetary Law.\n    *   Regulations issued by the Bank of Algeria.\n    *   Algerian laws governing electronic payments and currencies.\n*   **Risk Mitigation:** In the absence of clear authorization, this policy adopts a risk-averse position to prevent potential violations of Algerian law, which could include allegations of operating unauthorized payment systems or financial services.\n*   **Precautionary Principle:** Until such time as the Algerian authorities promulgate specific rules governing stablecoin activities, this policy enforces a complete restriction to safeguard the organization.\n\n---\n*Document End*\n```"

All transactions, both fiat and virtual asset, are subject to monitoring.\n\n### 5.6 Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR)\n1.  Any employee who detects a known or suspected suspicious transaction must immediately report it to the Compliance Officer.\n2.  The Compliance Officer is responsible for investigating the activity, determining if it is suspicious, and filing a SAR with the relevant FIU within the mandated timeframe, without tipping off the customer.\n3.  All SARs and supporting documentation will be kept strictly confidential and retained as required by law.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n*   **Compliance Officer:** [Company Name] has appointed a designated Compliance Officer with the authority and responsibility for implementing and overseeing the AML/CFT program.\n*   **Training:** All relevant employees will receive regular AML/CFT training, specific to the risks of virtual assets.\n*   **Record Keeping:** All CDD/EDD records, business correspondence, and transaction records will be maintained for a minimum of five (5) years after the termination of the business relationship or the execution of the occasional transaction, or as otherwise required by local law.\n*   **Independent Audit:** The AML/CFT program will be subject to an independent audit at least annually.\n\n## 7.

Policy Title\nGeographic Restrictions Policy Prohibiting Stablecoin Services in Algeria\n\n## 2. Purpose and Scope\n### 2.1 Purpose\nThis policy establishes clear and enforceable restrictions to ensure that the organization does not offer, market, sell, or facilitate any stablecoin-related services to residents or entities within the People’s Democratic Republic of Algeria (\"Algeria\"). This is a direct response to the absence of legal authorization or a regulatory framework for issuing or operating stablecoins in Algeria, thereby mitigating legal, regulatory, and reputational risks for the organization.\n\n### 2.2 Scope\nThis policy applies globally to:\n*   All employees, contractors, consultants, and temporary staff of the organization.\n*   All subsidiaries, affiliates, and partners acting on the organization's behalf.\n*   All products, services, websites, applications, and platforms owned or operated by the organization that involve stablecoins (digital assets designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified asset or pool of assets).\n*   All stages of customer interaction, including marketing, onboarding, transaction processing, and support.\n\n## 3. Definitions\n| Term | Definition |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Algerian Resident** | Any individual physically located in Algeria, or any entity (including corporations, partnerships, and organizations) incorporated, domiciled, or operating primarily within Algeria. |\n| **Geoblocking** | The use of technical measures to restrict access to digital services based on the user's geographical location, typically determined by IP address. |\n| **IP Address** | A unique numerical label assigned to a device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. |\n| **KYC (Know Your Customer)** | The process of verifying the identity of clients and assessing their suitability, along with potential risks of illegal intentions for the business relationship. |\n| **Onboarding** | The process through which a new customer applies for, and is granted, access to the organization's services. |\n| **Stablecoin Services** | Any activity involving the issuance, exchange, transfer, custody, marketing, sale, or facilitation of transactions using stablecoins. |\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\nIt is the policy of [Organization Name] to strictly prohibit the deliberate provision of any Stablecoin Services to Algerian Residents or entities. Due to the lack of a legal and regulatory framework authorizing stablecoin activities in Algeria, the organization will not engage with this jurisdiction. Any known or suspected provision of services to Algeria is a violation of this policy and may result in disciplinary action.\n\n## 5. Procedures\nTo enforce this policy, the following technical and operational procedures must be implemented:\n\n### 5.1 IP-Based Geoblocking\n*   The Technology Department shall implement and maintain robust IP address geoblocking on all customer-facing platforms (websites, APIs, mobile applications).\n*   This system must actively prevent users with IP addresses geolocated to Algeria from:\n    *   Accessing service registration/login pages.\n    *   Viewing marketing materials related to stablecoin services.\n    *   Downloading relevant applications from official stores.\n*   A block page must be displayed, stating that services are not available in the user's jurisdiction.\n\n### 5.2 Customer Onboarding & Ongoing Due Diligence\n*   The Compliance Department shall integrate Algerian jurisdiction checks into the KYC and customer onboarding workflow.\n*   **Proof of Address:** Required documentation for address verification (e.g., utility bill, bank statement) must be screened. Any document indicating an Algerian address must trigger an immediate application rejection.\n*   **Self-Declaration:** The onboarding application must include a mandatory declaration where the applicant confirms they are not a resident of any prohibited jurisdiction, including Algeria.\n*   **Ongoing Monitoring:** Periodic re-screening of customer profiles must be conducted to identify any customers who may have relocated to Algeria.\n\n### 5.3 Marketing & Business Development Restrictions\n*   The Marketing and Sales Departments are prohibited from targeting Algerian Residents with any promotional materials, advertisements, or communications related to stablecoin services.\n*   Digital marketing campaigns must use geo-targeting tools to explicitly exclude Algeria from all ad buys and social media promotions.\n*   Business development teams shall not pursue partnerships with entities known to be primarily serving the Algerian market.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n### 6.1 Employee Acknowledgment\nAll relevant personnel must complete training on this policy upon its implementation and annually thereafter. Acknowledgment of understanding and adherence is mandatory.\n\n### 6.2 Breach Reporting\nAny employee who identifies a potential breach of this policy (e.g., a customer suspected to be in Algeria, a technical failure in geoblocking) must immediately report it to their manager and the Compliance Department.\n\n### 6.3 Audit & Testing\nThe Internal Audit or Compliance Department will conduct quarterly tests to verify the effectiveness of the geoblocking controls and the accuracy of the onboarding checks. Findings will be documented and remediated.\n\n### 6.4 Consequences for Violation\nViolations of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contractual relationships. Service to any customer identified as an Algerian Resident will be terminated immediately.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule\nThis policy shall be reviewed **annually** by the Policy Owner (Legal & Compliance Department). Reviews will:\n*   Assess the effectiveness of controls.\n*   Evaluate changes in the regulatory landscape in Algeria.\n*   Incorporate technological advancements in geolocation and verification.\n*   Update procedures as necessary.\n\nAny major change in Algerian regulation regarding stablecoins will trigger an immediate, out-of-cycle review.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements\nThis policy is predicated on the following regulatory analysis:\n*   **Primary Reference:** The absence of explicit legal authorization for the issuance or operation of stablecoins under Algerian financial, banking, or payments regulations, including but not limited to:\n    *   Algerian Financial and Monetary Law.\n    *   Regulations issued by the Bank of Algeria.\n    *   Algerian laws governing electronic payments and currencies.\n*   **Risk Mitigation:** In the absence of clear authorization, this policy adopts a risk-averse position to prevent potential violations of Algerian law, which could include allegations of operating unauthorized payment systems or financial services.\n*   **Precautionary Principle:** Until such time as the Algerian authorities promulgate specific rules governing stablecoin activities, this policy enforces a complete restriction to safeguard the organization.\n\n---\n*Document End*\n```"

The company currently has no policies addressing the core regulatory requirements for stablecoin issuance or operation, particularly in light of Algeria's prohibitive stance. The most critical gap (GAP-001) is the lack of acknowledgment and mitigation for operating in a prohibited jurisdiction. Even for potential operations in other markets, the absence of foundational AML/CFT, consumer protection, and risk management policies represents a high-risk, non-compliant position. Immediate and comprehensive policy development is required before any stablecoin-related activity can be considered.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Legal authorization to issue or operate stablecoins in Algeria\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy exists\n\n**Gap:** Algerian law (Financial Law 2023) prohibits the use, holding, or trading of cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins. The company lacks any policy acknowledging this blanket prohibition or establishing procedures to ensure compliance with it.\n\n**Impact:** Operating in Algeria without acknowledging this prohibition exposes the company to severe legal penalties, including fines, criminal charges for executives, and complete cessation of operations. It represents a fundamental legal non-compliance.\n\n**Recommendation:** Immediately draft and implement a 'Geographic Restrictions Policy' that explicitly prohibits the offering, marketing, sale, or facilitation of stablecoin services to residents or entities within Algeria. Implement IP-based geoblocking and customer onboarding checks for Algerian jurisdiction.\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CFT) frameworks specific to virtual assets\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop a comprehensive 'AML/CFT Policy for Digital Assets' aligned with FATF Recommendations (especially Recommendation 15). This must include Risk-Based Approach (RBA), Customer Due Diligence (CDD) and Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) for stablecoin users, wallet screening, transaction monitoring rules, and SAR procedures.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements for stablecoin issuers\n\n**Recommendation:** Create a 'Stablecoin Issuance and Disclosure Policy' mandating regular, audited public attestations of reserves, clear terms of service outlining redemption mechanisms, and prominent risk disclosures to all potential and existing users.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Operational risk management and technology governance\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement an 'Operational Risk Framework for Digital Assets'. Key components should include a smart contract security audit protocol, a rigorous custodian selection and oversight policy, a comprehensive cybersecurity program, and a disaster recovery/business continuity plan specific to stablecoin operations.\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **Legal Authorization & Licensing**: not_met\n❌ **AML/CFT for VASPs**: not_met\n❌ **Consumer Protection & Disclosure**: not_met\n❌ **Operational Risk Management**: not_met\n❌ **Record-Keeping & Reporting**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update Summary\nGenerated: 2026-01-30T05:15:53.336759\n\n## Overview\nThis document summarizes proposed updates to company policies and standards based on regulatory gap analysis.\n\n## New Policies Required\n\n## Modified Policies\n\n### GAP-001\n**Category:** Legal\n**Current Policy:** No documented policy exists\n**Proposed Change:** Immediately draft and implement a 'Geographic Restrictions Policy' that explicitly prohibits the offering, marketing, sale, or facilitation of stablecoin services to residents or entities within Algeria.
