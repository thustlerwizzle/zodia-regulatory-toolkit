handling\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement consumer protection policy covering: clear terms of service, redemption procedures, fee transparency, and formal complaint resolution process\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity requirements for digital asset operations\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive operational risk management framework including: cybersecurity protocols, business continuity planning, and incident response procedures\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **stablecoin_licensing_requirements**: not_met\n❌
