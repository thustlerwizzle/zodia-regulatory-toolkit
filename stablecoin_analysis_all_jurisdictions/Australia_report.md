# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T05:53:49.205040

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits a complete lack of regulatory compliance framework for stablecoin operations in Australia. All critical regulatory areas are unaddressed, representing severe compliance risk. Immediate action is required to develop comprehensive policies across licensing, consumer protection, AML/CTF, reserve management, and operational resilience. The current state poses existential risk to the business, with potential for regulatory enforcement, significant fines, and criminal liability. A phased implementation approach is recommended, beginning with critical licensing and AML/CTF requirements, followed by consumer protection and operational policies.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Licensing requirement for stablecoin issuers under Australian financial services laws (AFSL requirement for financial product issuance)

**Current Status:** No documented policy on licensing or regulatory registration

**Gap:** Company lacks policies addressing the need for an Australian Financial Services License (AFSL) or equivalent authorization to issue stablecoins in Australia

**Impact:** Potential regulatory enforcement, fines, cease-and-desist orders, and criminal liability for operating without proper authorization

**Recommendation:** Immediately engage legal counsel to determine AFSL requirements and develop licensing strategy. Create policy framework for regulatory registration and licensing compliance.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Consumer protection requirements including disclosure, transparency, and fair dealing under ASIC regulatory framework

**Current Status:** No documented consumer protection policies specific to stablecoin operations

**Gap:** Missing policies for consumer disclosures, terms of service, risk warnings, and complaint handling procedures required by ASIC

**Impact:** Regulatory action for unfair practices, consumer harm, reputational damage, and potential class action lawsuits

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive consumer protection policy including clear disclosures, redemption procedures, risk warnings, and complaint resolution mechanisms.

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing (AML/CTF) compliance under AUSTRAC regulations

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CTF program for stablecoin operations

**Gap:** Company lacks AML/CTF program including customer identification, transaction monitoring, suspicious matter reporting, and record-keeping

**Impact:** Significant fines, criminal prosecution, loss of banking relationships, and regulatory sanctions

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive AML/CTF program including KYC procedures, transaction monitoring systems, and AUSTRAC reporting protocols.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Reserve management and custody requirements for stablecoin backing assets

**Recommendation:** Establish reserve management policy detailing asset composition, custody arrangements, audit requirements, and redemption mechanisms.

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity requirements for payment systems

**Recommendation:** Develop operational resilience framework including cybersecurity standards, incident response plans, and business continuity procedures.

### Gap 3: GAP-008
**Requirement:** Data privacy and protection under Privacy Act 1988 and Australian Privacy Principles

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive privacy policy compliant with Australian Privacy Principles, including data breach response procedures.
