# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-07T10:18:26.304925

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits critical compliance gaps across all major regulatory requirements for stablecoin operations in Bermuda. There is a complete absence of documented policies addressing Bermuda's Digital Asset Business Act requirements. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive regulatory compliance program before any stablecoin operations can commence. The highest priority should be given to licensing strategy, AML/CFT compliance, and reserve management policies, as these represent the most severe regulatory risks. Without addressing these gaps, the company cannot legally operate a stablecoin business in Bermuda and faces significant regulatory, financial, and reputational risks.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Bermuda's Digital Asset Business Act (DABA) requires licensing for stablecoin issuers, including capital requirements, governance standards, and consumer protection measures.

**Current Status:** No documented stablecoin-specific policies found

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing Bermuda's stablecoin regulatory framework

**Impact:** Legal non-compliance, potential regulatory enforcement actions, inability to operate legally in Bermuda, reputational damage

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive stablecoin policy framework aligned with DABA requirements, including licensing strategy, capital adequacy, redemption policies, and governance structures

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA) requires stablecoin issuers to maintain 1:1 reserves in high-quality liquid assets, with regular independent audits and public attestations.

**Current Status:** No reserve management or audit policies documented

**Gap:** Missing policies for reserve management, asset composition, audit requirements, and transparency reporting

**Impact:** Failure to meet reserve requirements could lead to regulatory sanctions, loss of consumer confidence, and potential insolvency risks

**Recommendation:** Establish reserve management policy specifying eligible assets, custody arrangements, audit frequency, and public reporting requirements

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance under Bermuda's Proceeds of Crime Act and related regulations, including KYC, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting.

**Current Status:** No stablecoin-specific AML/CFT policies documented

**Gap:** Existing AML policies (if any) not tailored to stablecoin transaction risks, wallet screening, or blockchain analytics requirements

**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, potential criminal liability, and exclusion from financial systems

**Recommendation:** Develop stablecoin-specific AML/CFT program including wallet screening, transaction monitoring for blockchain activities, and enhanced due diligence for large transactions

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** BMA requires comprehensive risk management frameworks including operational risk, liquidity risk, and cybersecurity protocols specific to stablecoin operations.

**Recommendation:** Develop stablecoin risk management framework covering operational, liquidity, market, and technology risks with clear mitigation strategies

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection requirements including clear redemption rights, fee transparency, and complaint handling procedures.

**Recommendation:** Create consumer protection policy detailing redemption rights, fee transparency, complaint procedures, and user education materials

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Governance requirements including board oversight, compliance function independence, and regular regulatory reporting.

**Recommendation:** Establish governance framework with clear roles, compliance function independence, board oversight committees, and regulatory reporting protocols
