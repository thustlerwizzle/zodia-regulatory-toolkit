## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no documented policies addressing stablecoin regulation in Madagascar. All regulatory requirements appear to be unmet based on available information. This represents an extreme compliance risk that requires immediate executive attention. The company should suspend any stablecoin operations in Madagascar until a comprehensive compliance framework is developed and approved. Priority should be given to understanding Madagascar's specific regulatory landscape through local legal counsel, as the research summary indicates limited information was obtained. The absence of basic policies for licensing, AML, and consumer protection creates existential business risks.
