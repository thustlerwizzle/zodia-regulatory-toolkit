All fundamental regulatory requirements are unmet, representing critical compliance deficiencies. Immediate action is required to establish basic policy frameworks before any stablecoin operations commence.

Definitions\n*   **Financial Authorities:** Domestic and foreign government agencies responsible for regulating financial services, digital assets, and payment systems (e.g., central banks, financial conduct authorities, securities commissions).\n*   **Jurisdictional Analysis:** A comprehensive assessment of the legal and regulatory landscape governing digital assets, e-money, and payment services in a specific country or region.\n*   **Licensing/Registration:** The formal process of obtaining approval, a license, charter, or registration from a Financial Authority to legally conduct the business of issuing stablecoins or providing related services.\n*   **Stablecoin:** A type of digital asset designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified reference asset or pool of assets (e.g., a fiat currency like the NZD or USD).\n*   **Target Markets:** Jurisdictions outside of Tokelau where the organization intends to offer stablecoin services to residents or entities.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\nIt is the policy of this organization that no stablecoin issuance activity shall commence or continue without first determining and securing all necessary licenses, registrations, or authorizations from the relevant Financial Authorities in Tokelau and each Target Market. The organization is committed to a proactive, principles-based approach to regulatory compliance, prioritizing legal adherence and consumer protection in all aspects of its stablecoin operations.\n\n## 5. Procedures\nTo implement this policy, the following procedures shall be followed:\n\n### 5.1 Initiation of Jurisdictional Analysis\n1.  Prior to the development or launch of any new stablecoin product, or before expanding into a new geographic market, the Compliance Department, in conjunction with Legal Counsel, shall initiate a formal Jurisdictional Analysis.\n2.  A project lead shall be appointed to oversee the analysis for each jurisdiction (Tokelau and each Target Market).\n\n### 5.2 Conducting the Jurisdictional Analysis\nThe analysis for each jurisdiction must, at a minimum, address:\n1.  **Regulatory Classification:** Determine how the stablecoin is classified under local law (e.g., e-money, security, commodity, payment token, value transfer instrument).\n2.  **Governing Authorities:** Identify all relevant Financial Authorities with oversight.\n3.  **Licensing Requirements:** Document specific licensing, registration, or authorization requirements, including application processes, forms, and fees.\n4.  **Ongoing Obligations:** Outline post-licensing compliance obligations (e.g., capital adequacy, reserve auditing, reporting, consumer disclosures, AML/CFT requirements).\n5.  **Prohibitions & Restrictions:** Identify any outright prohibitions or material restrictions on stablecoin activities.\n6.  **Gap Analysis:** Compare current organizational capabilities against regulatory requirements.\n\n### 5.3 Licensing Strategy Development\nBased on the Jurisdictional Analysis, the Compliance Department and Legal Counsel shall develop a written Licensing Strategy for each jurisdiction, which must include:\n1.  A determination of the specific license(s) or registration(s) required.\n2.  A roadmap and timeline for application preparation and submission.\n3.  Identification of required resources (internal and external, such as legal advisors).\n4.  A communication plan for engaging with regulators.\n5.  Contingency plans if licensing is not feasible or denied.\n\n### 5.4 Policy Framework Documentation\nThe findings of the Jurisdictional Analysis and the Licensing Strategy shall be used to develop or augment a comprehensive compliance policy framework, which shall be documented and include:\n*   Role-specific compliance manuals.\n*   Required internal controls.\n*   Reporting lines and accountability charts.\n*   Record-keeping protocols.\n\n### 5.5 Management Approval\nNo license application shall be submitted, and no stablecoin service shall be launched in a jurisdiction, without the prior written approval of the Chief Compliance Officer and the Executive Committee, confirming that the Licensing Strategy and policy framework are in place and adequate.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n*   **Mandatory Adherence:** All personnel are required to adhere to this policy and the resulting jurisdictional licensing strategies.\n*   **Pre-Launch Compliance:** Evidence of completed Jurisdictional Analysis, an approved Licensing Strategy, and submitted license applications (where required) must be obtained before any customer-facing activity begins.\n*   **Record Keeping:** All documentation related to Jurisdictional Analyses, Licensing Strategies, correspondence with regulators, and submitted applications must be maintained for a minimum of seven (7) years after the termination of services in that jurisdiction.\n*   **Reporting Violations:** Any suspected or actual violation of licensing requirements must be reported immediately to the Compliance Department.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule\nThis policy and all associated jurisdictional analyses and strategies shall be reviewed:\n*   **Annually** as part of the organization's standard compliance review cycle.\n*   **Immediately** upon notification of a material change in the regulatory landscape of Tokelau or any Target Market.\n*   **Prior to** the launch of a significantly modified stablecoin product or service.\nThe Compliance Department is responsible for coordinating these reviews and proposing necessary updates for management approval.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements\nThis policy is designed to satisfy the core regulatory principle prevalent in global jurisdictions that the issuance of stablecoins constitutes a regulated financial activity requiring formal oversight. While specific laws vary by jurisdiction, this policy framework anticipates compliance with regulatory regimes such as (but not limited to):\n*   **Tokelau:** [To be populated following Jurisdictional Analysis - Reference any existing Tokelau financial statutes, or if none, note the analysis of applicable New Zealand or regional frameworks].\n*   **Example Target Markets:** Potential reference to models like the EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) Regulation, New Zealand's Financial Markets Conduct Act, or other jurisdiction-specific e-money and payment services directives.\n*   **Cross-Cutting Standards:** Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Recommendations on Virtual Assets and VASPs.\n\n---\n**Policy Version:** 1.0  \n**Effective Date:** [Date of Approval]  \n**Approved By:** [Name, Title of Approver]\n```"

Policy Statement\nIt is the policy of this organization that no stablecoin issuance activity shall commence or continue without first determining and securing all necessary licenses, registrations, or authorizations from the relevant Financial Authorities in Tokelau and each Target Market.

Procedures\nTo implement this policy, the following procedures shall be followed:\n\n### 5.1 Initiation of Jurisdictional Analysis\n1.  Prior to the development or launch of any new stablecoin product, or before expanding into a new geographic market, the Compliance Department, in conjunction with Legal Counsel, shall initiate a formal Jurisdictional Analysis.\n2.  A project lead shall be appointed to oversee the analysis for each jurisdiction (Tokelau and each Target Market).\n\n### 5.2 Conducting the Jurisdictional Analysis\nThe analysis for each jurisdiction must, at a minimum, address:\n1.  **Regulatory Classification:** Determine how the stablecoin is classified under local law (e.g., e-money, security, commodity, payment token, value transfer instrument).\n2.  **Governing Authorities:** Identify all relevant Financial Authorities with oversight.\n3.  **Licensing Requirements:** Document specific licensing, registration, or authorization requirements, including application processes, forms, and fees.\n4.  **Ongoing Obligations:** Outline post-licensing compliance obligations (e.g., capital adequacy, reserve auditing, reporting, consumer disclosures, AML/CFT requirements).\n5.  **Prohibitions & Restrictions:** Identify any outright prohibitions or material restrictions on stablecoin activities.\n6.  **Gap Analysis:** Compare current organizational capabilities against regulatory requirements.\n\n### 5.3 Licensing Strategy Development\nBased on the Jurisdictional Analysis, the Compliance Department and Legal Counsel shall develop a written Licensing Strategy for each jurisdiction, which must include:\n1.  A determination of the specific license(s) or registration(s) required.\n2.  A roadmap and timeline for application preparation and submission.\n3.  Identification of required resources (internal and external, such as legal advisors).\n4.  A communication plan for engaging with regulators.\n5.  Contingency plans if licensing is not feasible or denied.\n\n### 5.4 Policy Framework Documentation\nThe findings of the Jurisdictional Analysis and the Licensing Strategy shall be used to develop or augment a comprehensive compliance policy framework, which shall be documented and include:\n*   Role-specific compliance manuals.\n*   Required internal controls.\n*   Reporting lines and accountability charts.\n*   Record-keeping protocols.\n\n### 5.5 Management Approval\nNo license application shall be submitted, and no stablecoin service shall be launched in a jurisdiction, without the prior written approval of the Chief Compliance Officer and the Executive Committee, confirming that the Licensing Strategy and policy framework are in place and adequate.\n\n## 6.

References to Regulatory Requirements\nThis policy is designed to satisfy the core regulatory principle prevalent in global jurisdictions that the issuance of stablecoins constitutes a regulated financial activity requiring formal oversight. While specific laws vary by jurisdiction, this policy framework anticipates compliance with regulatory regimes such as (but not limited to):\n*   **Tokelau:** [To be populated following Jurisdictional Analysis - Reference any existing Tokelau financial statutes, or if none, note the analysis of applicable New Zealand or regional frameworks].\n*   **Example Target Markets:** Potential reference to models like the EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) Regulation, New Zealand's Financial Markets Conduct Act, or other jurisdiction-specific e-money and payment services directives.\n*   **Cross-Cutting Standards:** Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Recommendations on Virtual Assets and VASPs.\n\n---\n**Policy Version:** 1.0  \n**Effective Date:** [Date of Approval]  \n**Approved By:** [Name, Title of Approver]\n```"
