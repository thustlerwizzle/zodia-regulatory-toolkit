All fundamental regulatory requirements are unmet, representing critical regulatory risk. Immediate action is required to establish basic compliance frameworks before commencing operations. The most critical gaps requiring immediate attention are licensing authorization, reserve management, and AML/CTF compliance. Without addressing these foundational requirements, the company faces severe regulatory consequences including enforcement actions, fines, and potential criminal liability. A phased implementation approach is recommended, starting with regulatory engagement and licensing, followed by core compliance program development."

Purpose and Scope\n### 2.1 Purpose\nThis policy establishes a comprehensive framework to ensure that all issued stablecoins are fully backed by 1:1 reserves held in High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA). The policy is designed to ensure operational integrity, regulatory compliance, and transparent stewardship of user funds.\n\n### 2.2 Scope\nThis policy applies to all activities related to the issuance, redemption, and reserve management of [Company Name]'s stablecoin (e.g., [Ticker Symbol]). It is binding for all relevant departments, including Treasury, Finance, Compliance, and Risk Management.\n\n## 3. Definitions\n*   **Stablecoin:** A digital asset issued by [Company Name] designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified fiat currency (e.g., USD).\n*   **Reserves:** The total pool of assets held to back the total circulating supply of stablecoins.\n*   **High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA):** Assets that are low-risk, easily and immediately convertible into cash with minimal loss of value, as defined in Section 5.1.\n*   **Custodian:** A regulated financial institution responsible for the safekeeping of reserve assets.\n*   **Attestation:** A monthly examination and report by an independent third-party firm providing reasonable assurance on the sufficiency and composition of reserves.\n*   **Circulating Supply:** The total number of stablecoins issued and held by the public.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\n[Company Name] shall, at all times, maintain reserve assets with a fair market value equal to or greater than 100% of the face value of all outstanding stablecoins. These reserves shall be held exclusively in HQLA, segregated from corporate operating funds, and held with regulated custodians. The composition and value of these reserves will be subject to independent verification and public disclosure.\n\n## 5. Procedures\n\n### 5.1 Eligible Reserve Asset Classes\nReserves must be held in the following HQLA tiers, in descending order of preference and quality:\n*   **Tier 1A: Cash and Cash Equivalents**\n    *   Physical currency.\n    *   Deposits held in demand or savings accounts at U.S. federally insured depository institutions (up to insured limits).\n    *   Overnight deposits at central banks.\n*   **Tier 1B: Short-Term Government Securities**\n    *   Direct obligations of the U.S. Treasury (e.g., T-Bills) with a remaining maturity of 90 days or less.\n    *   Securities issued by other sovereign governments with a credit rating of AA- or higher and remaining maturity of 90 days or less.\n*   **Tier 2: High-Quality Liquid Debt (Subject to Aggregate Cap)**\n    *   U.S. Treasury notes and bonds with a remaining maturity of 1 year or less.\n    *   Securities issued by U.S. government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) with a remaining maturity of 90 days or less.\n    *   **Cap:** The aggregate value of Tier 2 assets shall not exceed 30% of total reserves.\n\n### 5.2 Custody Arrangements\n1.  All reserve assets must be held with one or more **Qualified Custodians**.\n2.  A Qualified Custodian is defined as a U.S. state or federally chartered bank, trust company, or a broker-dealer registered with the SEC and subject to net capital and custody rules.\n3.  Reserve assets must be held in segregated accounts, clearly designated for the benefit of stablecoin holders, and are not available to satisfy claims of [Company Name]'s general creditors.\n4.  The Treasury Department must conduct initial and annual due diligence on all custodians, assessing their financial health, regulatory standing, and operational controls.\n\n### 5.3 Issuance and Redemption Protocol\n1.  **Issuance:** For every new stablecoin minted and issued, an equivalent fiat value must be received and converted into HQLA in the reserve account *prior to or simultaneously with* the stablecoin's release to the user.\n2.  **Redemption:** Upon receipt of a valid redemption request, the corresponding stablecoin tokens shall be promptly burned (permanently removed from circulation). Equivalent HQLA from the reserve shall be liquidated, and proceeds shall be transferred to the redeeming user within [e.g., 1-2] business days.\n\n### 5.4 Daily Reserve Management\n1.  The Treasury Department shall perform a daily reconciliation comparing the total circulating stablecoin supply to the total fair market value of the reserve holdings.\n2.  Any shortfall must be remedied within one (1) business day by depositing additional qualifying assets.\n3.  Any excess reserve value exceeding 102% of the circulating supply shall be reviewed for potential rebalancing or shareholder benefit, following a separate governance procedure.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n\n### 6.1 Independent Attestations and Audits\n1.  **Monthly Attestation:** An independent accounting firm, engaged by the Audit Committee of the Board, shall perform a monthly examination. The resulting attestation report (e.g., under SOC 2 or agreed-upon procedures) must confirm:\n    *   The fair market value of the reserve assets was equal to or greater than the face value of circulating stablecoins as of the month-end date.\n    *   The reserve composition complied with the eligible asset classes defined in this policy.\n    *   The assets were held in segregated accounts with the designated regulated custodians.\n2.  **Annual Audit:** Reserves shall be included in the scope of the company's annual financial statement audit performed by an independent registered public accounting firm.\n\n### 6.2 Public Disclosure\n1.  A dedicated, publicly accessible webpage (e.g., [Company Website]/transparency) shall be maintained.\n2.  Within **seven (7) calendar days** following the month-end close, the following shall be published:\n    *   The most recent monthly attestation report.\n    *   A detailed breakdown of the reserve composition by asset class and issuer.\n    *   The total face value of stablecoins in circulation and the total fair market value of reserves.\n    *   The names of all custodians holding reserve assets.\n\n### 6.3 Internal Controls & Reporting\n1.  The Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) is responsible for overseeing adherence to this policy.\n2.  A quarterly report on reserve status, custodian health, and compliance with this policy shall be presented to the Board of Directors' Risk and Compliance Committee.\n3.  All employees involved in reserve management must complete annual training on this policy.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule\nThis policy shall be reviewed annually by the Legal, Compliance, and Treasury departments to ensure ongoing alignment with regulatory developments and operational best practices. Any material changes require approval by the Board of Directors.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements\nThis policy is designed to comply with and anticipates regulatory requirements for stablecoin issuers, including but not limited to the principle of maintaining 1:1 reserves in HQLA as discussed in:\n*   The President's Working Group (PWG) Report on Stablecoins (November 2021).\n*   Proposed legislative frameworks such as the *Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act* and the *Stablecoin Innovation and Protection Act*.\n*   Relevant guidance from federal banking agencies regarding liquidity and custody standards.\n\n---\n**Policy Version:** 1.0  \n**Effective Date:** [Date]  \n**Approved By:** [Name, Title of Approver]\n```"

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Falkland Islands\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-02-07T10:28:56.761907\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company exhibits a complete absence of regulatory compliance infrastructure for stablecoin operations in the Falkland Islands jurisdiction. All fundamental regulatory requirements are unmet, representing critical regulatory risk. Immediate action is required to establish basic compliance frameworks before commencing operations. The most critical gaps requiring immediate attention are licensing authorization, reserve management, and AML/CTF compliance. Without addressing these foundational requirements, the company faces severe regulatory consequences including enforcement actions, fines, and potential criminal liability. A phased implementation approach is recommended, starting with regulatory engagement and licensing, followed by core compliance program development.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must maintain 1:1 reserves in high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) for all issued tokens\n\n**Current Status:** No documented reserve management policy exists\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of reserve management framework, custody arrangements, or asset verification procedures\n\n**Impact:** Regulatory enforcement action, license revocation, reputational damage, and potential insolvency if reserves are insufficient\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop and implement a comprehensive reserve management policy specifying: 1) Eligible asset classes (cash, government securities, etc.), 2) Custody arrangements with regulated custodians, 3) Monthly independent attestations/audits, 4) Public disclosure of reserve composition\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must obtain authorization/license from the Falkland Islands Financial Services Commission (FIFSC) or equivalent regulator\n\n**Current Status:** No licensing or authorization policy exists\n\n**Gap:** No documented process for regulatory engagement, licensing applications, or ongoing regulatory reporting\n\n**Impact:** Operating illegally, immediate cease-and-desist orders, fines, and criminal liability for directors\n\n**Recommendation:** 1) Conduct regulatory mapping to identify exact licensing requirements, 2) Establish regulatory engagement protocol, 3) Create licensing application project plan with timelines and responsibilities, 4) Designate compliance officer with regulatory liaison responsibility\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance including customer due diligence (CDD), transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting\n\n**Current Status:** No AML/CTF program exists\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of KYC procedures, transaction monitoring systems, sanctions screening, or suspicious activity reporting mechanisms\n\n**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, loss of banking relationships, potential criminal prosecution for money laundering offenses\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement a risk-based AML/CTF program including: 1) Customer identification and verification procedures, 2) Ongoing transaction monitoring system, 3) Sanctions screening against OFAC, UN, and EU lists, 4) Designated Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO), 5) Regular staff training\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including clear disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling procedures\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop consumer protection framework including: 1) Clear, plain-language terms of service, 2) Guaranteed redemption rights with defined timelines, 3) Transparent fee schedule, 4) Formal complaint handling procedure with escalation paths, 5) Public-facing disclosures about risks and protections\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity requirements for payment systems and financial institutions\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish operational resilience framework: 1) Business impact analysis, 2) Incident response plan, 3) Cybersecurity controls aligned with NIST or ISO 27001, 4) Third-party vendor risk management program, 5) Regular penetration testing and security audits\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-006\n**Requirement:** Governance and risk management framework with board oversight and independent compliance function\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish governance framework: 1) Board risk committee charter, 2) Three lines of defense model, 3) Independent compliance function with direct board reporting, 4) Comprehensive risk assessment process, 5) Regular board training on regulatory obligations\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **licensing_and_authorization**: not_met\n❌ **reserve_requirements**: not_met\n❌ **aml_ctf_compliance**: not_met\n❌
