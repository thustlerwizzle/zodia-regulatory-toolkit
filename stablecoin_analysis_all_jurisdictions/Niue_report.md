# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-12T13:15:26.813883

## Executive Summary
The company currently has no documented policies addressing Niue's stablecoin regulatory requirements, resulting in complete non-compliance across all critical regulatory domains. Immediate action is required to develop and implement a comprehensive regulatory compliance framework specific to Niue's jurisdiction. The most critical gaps relate to licensing, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance, which could result in severe regulatory consequences if not addressed promptly. A phased implementation approach is recommended, starting with licensing and reserve policies, followed by AML/CFT and consumer protection frameworks.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance requires licensing/registration with Niue financial authorities

**Current Status:** No documented policy for Niue-specific licensing requirements

**Gap:** Company lacks policies addressing Niue's regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers, including licensing procedures, application requirements, and ongoing regulatory reporting obligations

**Impact:** Operating without proper licensing could result in regulatory enforcement actions, fines, business suspension, and reputational damage

**Recommendation:** Establish Niue-specific licensing policy including: 1) Application process for stablecoin issuer license, 2) Capital requirements documentation, 3) Regulatory reporting framework, 4) Compliance officer designation for Niue operations

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Stablecoin reserves must be fully backed and subject to regular independent audits

**Current Status:** No specific policy addressing Niue's reserve requirements and audit standards

**Gap:** Missing policy requirements for: 1) Composition of reserve assets acceptable under Niue law, 2) Segregation of reserve assets, 3) Frequency and standards for independent audits, 4) Public disclosure of reserve composition

**Impact:** Failure to maintain compliant reserves could lead to regulatory sanctions, loss of consumer confidence, and potential insolvency risks

**Recommendation:** Develop reserve management policy aligned with Niue requirements including: 1) Acceptable reserve asset classes, 2) Custody arrangements, 3) Quarterly independent audit requirements, 4) Public disclosure protocols for reserve status

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance including customer due diligence and transaction monitoring

**Recommendation:** Create Niue-specific AML/CFT policy incorporating: 1) Customer due diligence procedures per Niue standards, 2) Transaction monitoring rules, 3) Suspicious activity reporting to Niue FIU, 4) Record-keeping requirements

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including disclosures and redemption rights

**Recommendation:** Implement consumer protection policy covering: 1) Mandatory disclosures for Niue customers, 2) Redemption process documentation, 3) Complaint resolution procedures, 4) Risk warning requirements
