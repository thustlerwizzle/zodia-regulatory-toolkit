Create policy framework for regulatory engagement\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance specific to stablecoins\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found\n\n**Gap:** No AML/CTF policies tailored to stablecoin operations, including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting\n\n**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties, reputational damage, potential criminal charges for AML/CTF violations\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Develop comprehensive AML/CTF policy framework for stablecoin operations 2. Implement customer identification and verification procedures 3. Establish transaction monitoring systems 4. Create suspicious activity reporting protocols\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures for stablecoin users\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Develop consumer protection policy framework 2. Create clear disclosure documents 3. Establish complaint resolution procedures 4.
