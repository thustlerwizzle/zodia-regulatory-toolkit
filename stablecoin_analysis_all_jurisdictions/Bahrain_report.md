# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T06:19:35.874509

## Executive Summary
The company currently has no documented policies addressing Bahrain's stablecoin regulatory requirements. This represents a critical compliance gap that prevents lawful operation of stablecoin services in Bahrain. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive policy framework aligned with CBB Rulebook Volume 6 before pursuing any stablecoin-related activities. The most critical gaps relate to licensing prerequisites, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance, which are fundamental to obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB) Rulebook Volume 6 (FinTech) requires stablecoin issuers to obtain a license under the Crypto-Asset Module (CRA) and comply with capital adequacy, governance, and risk management requirements.

**Current Status:** No documented policies for stablecoin issuance or operations in Bahrain.

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing CBB licensing requirements, capital requirements, governance structure, and risk management framework for stablecoin operations.

**Impact:** Operating without CBB license could result in regulatory enforcement actions, fines, business shutdown, and reputational damage.

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive stablecoin policy framework aligned with CBB Rulebook Volume 6, including licensing strategy, capital planning, governance model, and risk management protocols.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** CBB requires stablecoin issuers to maintain 100% reserve backing with high-quality liquid assets held in segregated accounts with regulated custodians.

**Current Status:** No reserve management or custody policies exist.

**Gap:** Missing policies for reserve composition, custody arrangements, segregation of assets, and regular attestation/audit requirements.

**Impact:** Failure to maintain proper reserves could lead to insolvency, loss of customer funds, regulatory penalties, and loss of market confidence.

**Recommendation:** Establish reserve management policy specifying eligible assets, custody arrangements with CBB-approved institutions, segregation requirements, and third-party attestation procedures.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** CBB mandates comprehensive AML/CFT compliance including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting per Bahrain's AML Law and CBB Rulebook.

**Recommendation:** Develop stablecoin-specific AML/CFT policy incorporating blockchain analytics, wallet screening, transaction monitoring, and travel rule compliance procedures.

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** CBB requires stablecoin issuers to implement robust cybersecurity measures, operational resilience, and business continuity planning.

**Recommendation:** Create comprehensive cybersecurity framework for stablecoin operations including smart contract auditing, key management, DDoS protection, and incident response plans.
