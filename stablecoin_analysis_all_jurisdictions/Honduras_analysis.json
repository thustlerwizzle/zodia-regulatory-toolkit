This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Honduras\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-01-31T00:15:11.099813\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company is in a state of total non-compliance. No policies were provided for analysis, indicating a complete absence of the foundational governance, risk, and compliance frameworks required to operate a regulated financial instrument like a stablecoin. The gaps are systemic and severe. Immediate action is required to develop all critical policies from the ground up, with a primary focus on legal authorization, AML/CFT, and reserve management before any operational activity can be considered. Engagement with Honduran regulators and specialized legal counsel is the first and most critical step.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Legal authorization to issue stablecoins. Most jurisdictions require specific licensing or registration for stablecoin issuers, often under payment services, e-money, or specific digital asset frameworks.\n\n**Current Status:** No policy identified. The company policies document is empty, indicating no formal governance framework exists.\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of any policy or procedure addressing the legal foundation for operating a stablecoin service. There is no evidence of licensing strategy, regulatory engagement, or legal risk assessment.\n\n**Impact:** Operating without proper authorization could lead to immediate enforcement actions, including cease-and-desist orders, significant fines, criminal liability for directors, and reputational damage making future licensing impossible.\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Immediately suspend any operational activity related to stablecoin issuance. 2. Conduct urgent legal research to determine Honduras's specific regulatory stance (consulting local counsel is mandatory). 3. Develop a 'Market Entry and Licensing Strategy' policy outlining the steps to obtain necessary approvals before any product launch.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Robust reserve management and attestation. Global standards (e.g., from IOSCO, FSIB) and many national regulations mandate that stablecoin reserves be held in secure, low-risk assets, fully backed 1:1, and subject to frequent, independent attestation or audit.\n\n**Current Status:** No policy identified.\n\n**Gap:** No policy governing the custody, composition, or verification of reserves backing the stablecoin. There is no framework for asset segregation, redemption procedures, or third-party oversight.\n\n**Impact:** Risk of insolvency and inability to honor redemptions, leading to a 'break-the-buck' event. This would trigger consumer protection lawsuits, regulatory intervention for fraud or misrepresentation, and collapse of trust in the product.\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop a comprehensive 'Reserve Management and Assurance Policy'. This must detail: acceptable reserve assets (e.g., cash, short-term treasuries), custody requirements with qualified custodians, a 1:1 backing mandate, and schedules for monthly attestations and quarterly full-scope audits by a registered public accounting firm.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (CFT) compliance. This includes KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting (SAR), and sanctions screening, as mandated by FATF recommendations and national AML laws.\n\n**Current Status:** No policy identified.\n\n**Gap:** Complete lack of an AML/CFT program. No procedures for customer identification, ongoing due diligence, monitoring transactions, reporting suspicious activities, or screening against sanctions lists.\n\n**Impact:** High risk of the stablecoin being used for illicit finance, leading to severe regulatory penalties, loss of banking partnerships, de-risking by correspondents, and potential criminal prosecution of the company and its principals.\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement a risk-based AML/CFT Program immediately. This includes: a written policy, appointment of a Compliance Officer, automated KYC/CDD onboarding, real-time transaction monitoring systems, sanctions/PEP screening tools, and procedures for filing SARs with the Honduran Financial Intelligence Unit (UIF).\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure. Regulations typically require clear, fair terms of service, disclosure of risks (including reserve details and redemption rights), and a complaint handling mechanism.\n\n**Recommendation:** Draft and publish clear 'Terms of Service' and a 'Risk Disclosure Statement'. Establish a 'Customer Complaint Resolution Policy' with defined timelines, escalation paths, and logging procedures to ensure issues are tracked and resolved fairly.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Cybersecurity and operational resilience. Financial regulators expect stringent controls to protect customer data and funds, including incident response plans, business continuity plans, and regular security testing.\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop and implement an 'Information Security Management Policy' aligned with a framework like ISO 27001 or NIST CSF. This must be accompanied by a tested 'Incident Response Plan' and a 'Business Continuity Plan' to ensure service availability and rapid recovery from disruptions.\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **Legal Authorization & Licensing**: not_met\n❌ **Reserve Management & Assurance**: not_met\n❌ **AML/CFT Compliance**: not_met\n❌ **Consumer Protection & Disclosure**: not_met\n❌ **Cybersecurity & Operational Resilience**: not_met\n❌ **Governance & Risk Management**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update Summary\nGenerated: 2026-01-31T00:16:04.812650\n\n## Overview\nThis document summarizes proposed updates to company policies and standards based on regulatory gap analysis.\n\n## New Policies Required\n\n## Modified Policies\n\n### GAP-001\n**Category:** Legal\n**Current Policy:** No policy identified.
