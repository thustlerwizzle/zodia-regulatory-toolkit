Immediate action is required to establish a comprehensive compliance framework, beginning with critical gaps related to legal authorization, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance.

Purpose and Scope\n### 2.1 Purpose\nThis policy establishes a comprehensive framework for the management, custody, auditing, and public disclosure of reserves backing all stablecoins issued by [Organization Name]. The policy ensures that stablecoins are fully backed by high-quality assets, maintained in secure custody, regularly verified, and transparently disclosed to regulators and the public, thereby promoting trust, stability, and regulatory compliance.\n\n### 2.2 Scope\nThis policy applies to:\n*   All stablecoin issuance activities of [Organization Name].\n*   All personnel involved in treasury management, reserve custody, financial reporting, compliance, and audit functions.\n*   All third-party custodians, auditors, and service providers engaged in reserve management activities.\n*   The entire lifecycle of reserve assets, from acquisition and custody to valuation, reporting, and redemption.\n\n## 3. Definitions\n*   **Stablecoin:** A digital asset issued by [Organization Name] designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified fiat currency (e.g., USD, EUR).\n*   **Reserve Assets:** The collective pool of assets held to fully back the outstanding supply of stablecoins at par value.\n*   **High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA):** Assets that are low-risk, easily and immediately convertible into cash with minimal loss of value, as defined in Section 5.1.\n*   **Custodian:** A regulated financial institution or qualified custodian responsible for the safekeeping of Reserve Assets.\n*   **Attestation:** A formal examination and opinion by an independent third-party audit firm regarding the sufficiency and composition of the Reserve Assets.\n*   **Par Value:** The face value of the stablecoin, typically pegged to 1 unit of the reference fiat currency.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\n[Organization Name] is committed to maintaining a 1:1 reserve ratio for all issued stablecoins. Every unit of stablecoin in circulation will be backed by an equivalent par value of Reserve Assets held in segregated, bankruptcy-remote accounts. Reserve Assets will consist predominantly of High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA). The management of these reserves will adhere to the highest standards of security, transparency, and regulatory compliance through secure custody arrangements, frequent independent attestations, and detailed public disclosures.\n\n## 5. Procedures\n\n### 5.1 Composition of Reserve Assets\nReserve Assets shall be held in the following structure:\n*   **Tier 1 Assets (Minimum 80% of Total Reserves):** Cash and Cash Equivalents.\n    *   Direct deposits in USD or pegged fiat currency held in segregated accounts at U.S. or equivalent jurisdiction federally insured depository institutions.\n    *   U.S. Treasury securities with remaining maturity of 90 days or less.\n    *   Overnight reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities.\n*   **Tier 2 Assets (Maximum 20% of Total Reserves):** Other High-Quality Assets.\n    *   U.S. Treasury securities with maturities greater than 90 days but less than 2 years.\n    *   Notes and bonds issued by U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) with maturities under 2 years.\n    *   Commercial paper and corporate debt securities rated A-1/P-1 or higher with maturities under 90 days.\n*   **Prohibited Assets:** Cryptocurrencies, equities, speculative derivatives, unsecured debt, securities issued by [Organization Name] or its affiliates, and any illiquid or high-risk instruments are strictly prohibited.\n\n### 5.2 Custody and Safekeeping\n*   All Reserve Assets must be held with Qualified Custodians that are:\n    *   Regulated as a trust company, bank, or broker-dealer in a reputable jurisdiction.\n    *   Subject to annual independent financial audits.\n    *   Capable of providing segregated, bankruptcy-remote account structures.\n*   [Organization Name]’s access to Reserve Assets is strictly limited to facilitating redemptions and rebalancing the portfolio in accordance with this policy. No Reserve Assets may be encumbered, lent, re-hypothecated, or used as collateral for other activities.\n\n### 5.3 Valuation and Reserve Adequacy\n*   The total market value of Reserve Assets will be calculated daily using mark-to-market principles from reliable pricing sources.\n*   The reserve ratio (Total Value of Reserve Assets / Total Par Value of Stablecoins in Circulation) must be maintained at or above 100% at all times.\n*   Automated monitoring systems will alert treasury management if the reserve ratio falls below a 102% threshold, triggering immediate remedial action.\n\n### 5.4 Independent Audit and Attestation\n*   An independent, registered public accounting firm will perform a monthly attestation engagement in accordance with the AICPA’s SOC 2 or equivalent standard.\n*   The attestation report will confirm:\n    1.

The redemption process will be funded directly from the Reserve Assets.\n\n### 6.4 Non-Compliance\nAny breach of the reserve ratio, custody rules, or prohibited asset restrictions constitutes a major policy violation. The Chief Compliance Officer and Board of Directors must be notified immediately. Corrective action, which may include halting new stablecoin issuance or using corporate capital to replenish reserves, must be taken within 24 hours.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule\nThis policy shall be reviewed annually by the Legal, Compliance, and Treasury departments. It will be updated more frequently as necessary to reflect changes in:\n*   Applicable laws and regulatory guidance from bodies such as the SEC, OCC, FDIC, and state financial regulators.\n*   Evolving market standards and best practices for stablecoin reserves.\n*   The financial product offerings of [Organization Name].\nAll updates require approval from the Chief Compliance Officer and the Chief Financial Officer.\n\n## 8.

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Saint Helena\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-02-12T13:45:08.227851\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company exhibits a complete lack of policies addressing stablecoin regulation in Saint Helena. All fundamental regulatory requirements are unmet, creating significant legal, operational, and reputational risks. Immediate action is required to establish a comprehensive compliance framework, beginning with critical gaps related to legal authorization, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance. Given the absence of specific Saint Helena regulations identified in the research, the company should adopt a conservative approach based on international standards (FSB, FATF) and comparable jurisdictions while engaging directly with Saint Helena authorities to clarify requirements.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Legal authorization to issue stablecoins in Saint Helena jurisdiction\n\n**Current Status:** No policy exists regarding jurisdictional authorization\n\n**Gap:** Company lacks any policy or procedure to determine if stablecoin issuance is legally permitted in Saint Helena or to obtain necessary licenses/registrations\n\n**Impact:** Potential for operating without legal authority, leading to regulatory enforcement, fines, license revocation, and reputational damage\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish a jurisdictional compliance policy requiring legal review and regulatory approval before offering stablecoin services in any jurisdiction\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Reserve requirements and asset backing for stablecoins\n\n**Current Status:** No documented reserve management policy\n\n**Gap:** No policy exists regarding the composition, custody, auditing, or transparency of reserve assets backing stablecoins\n\n**Impact:** Risk of insufficient backing, leading to loss of peg, consumer harm, and regulatory sanctions\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive reserve management policy specifying asset types, custody arrangements, regular audits, and public disclosure requirements\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance for stablecoin transactions\n\n**Current Status:** No specific AML/CFT policy for stablecoin operations\n\n**Gap:** Lack of policy addressing customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting specific to stablecoin activities\n\n**Impact:** Exposure to money laundering and terrorist financing risks, regulatory penalties, and potential criminal liability\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement stablecoin-specific AML/CFT program including KYC procedures, transaction monitoring, and SAR filing protocols\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements\n\n**Recommendation:** Create comprehensive disclosure policy covering all material risks, terms, and conditions of stablecoin offerings\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish operational risk framework addressing cybersecurity, smart contract auditing, disaster recovery, and incident response\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **jurisdictional_authorization**: not_met\n❌ **reserve_requirements**: not_met\n❌ **aml_cft_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **consumer_protection**: not_met\n❌ **operational_risk**: not_met\n❌ **governance_framework**: not_met\n❌ **regulatory_reporting**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update
