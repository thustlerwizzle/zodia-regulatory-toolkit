# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T23:18:20.835416

## Executive Summary
The company currently has no documented policies for stablecoin operations in Georgia, representing a complete regulatory compliance gap. All critical regulatory requirements are unmet, exposing the company to significant legal, financial, and reputational risks. Immediate action is required to establish foundational compliance frameworks, particularly for licensing, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance. The company should prioritize engagement with Georgian regulators to clarify specific requirements while developing comprehensive policies and controls.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance requires licensing/registration with Georgian financial authorities (National Bank of Georgia).

**Current Status:** No documented policy for regulatory registration or licensing.

**Gap:** Company lacks procedures for obtaining necessary licenses to issue stablecoins in Georgia.

**Impact:** Operating without proper licensing could result in regulatory enforcement actions, fines, and business shutdown.

**Recommendation:** Establish a regulatory licensing framework and engage with National Bank of Georgia to understand specific licensing requirements.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must maintain adequate reserves to back issued tokens (typically 1:1 with high-quality liquid assets).

**Current Status:** No documented reserve management policy.

**Gap:** Missing policies governing reserve composition, custody, auditing, and transparency.

**Impact:** Failure to maintain adequate reserves risks consumer protection violations, loss of trust, and regulatory penalties.

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive reserve management policy including asset types, custody arrangements, and third-party audit requirements.

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting.

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT program.

**Gap:** Complete absence of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls.

**Impact:** Significant regulatory enforcement risk, potential criminal liability, and reputational damage.

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive AML/CFT program aligned with Georgian legislation and FATF standards.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling.

**Recommendation:** Establish consumer protection framework with clear terms of service, redemption policies, and complaint handling procedures.

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity requirements.

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive risk management framework including cybersecurity protocols, business continuity plans, and incident response procedures.

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Governance requirements including board oversight, compliance function, and internal controls.

**Recommendation:** Establish formal governance structure with board oversight, appoint compliance officer, and implement internal control framework.
