All personnel are required to adhere to the procedures outlined herein to mitigate AML/CFT risks associated with our Brazilian operations.\n\n## 5. Procedures\n\n### 5.1 Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) for Brazilian Customers\nEDD must be applied in the following circumstances:\n1. **Customer Risk Categorization:** All Brazilian customers must be classified as Low, Medium, or High Risk based on factors including occupation, business activity, transaction patterns, geographic location, and whether they are a PEP.\n2. **High-Risk Customers:** For customers classified as High Risk (including but not limited to PEPs, customers from high-risk jurisdictions, or those involved in cash-intensive businesses), the following EDD measures are mandatory:\n    - Obtaining additional identifying information and documentation.\n    - Establishing the source of wealth and source of funds.\n    - Obtaining senior management approval for establishing and maintaining the business relationship.\n    - Conducting enhanced ongoing monitoring of the business relationship.\n3. **Record Keeping:** All documentation obtained during CDD and EDD must be maintained for at least five (5) years after the termination of the business relationship, as required by law.\n\n### 5.2 Transaction Monitoring Thresholds\nMonitoring systems and manual reviews must be calibrated to detect transactions that are unusual or suspicious, with particular attention to the following thresholds and scenarios aligned with BCB guidance:\n1. **Mandatory Monitoring Thresholds:**\n    - Cash transactions exceeding R$ 100,000 (or equivalent in foreign currency), whether conducted in a single operation or several linked operations.\n    - Any transaction, regardless of value, that is structurally complex, unusual for the customer, lacks apparent economic or legal purpose, or involves high-risk jurisdictions.\n2. **Monitoring Procedures:**\n    - Automated systems will flag transactions meeting defined risk parameters.\n    - The Compliance Department will investigate flagged transactions daily.\n    - Patterns of activity designed to avoid threshold reporting (e.g., smurfing) will be identified and treated as a single suspicious transaction.\n\n### 5.3 COAF Reporting Procedures\n1. **Identification of Suspicious Activity:** Any employee who suspects or has reasonable grounds to suspect that a transaction involves funds derived from illegal activities or is intended to finance terrorism must immediately report their suspicion to the Brazil Compliance Officer.\n2. **Internal Reporting:** The internal Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) form must be completed and submitted to the Brazil Compliance Officer without delay. Reporting employees are protected from liability for breach of confidentiality.\n3. **Filing with COAF:** The Brazil Compliance Officer is responsible for assessing internal SARs. Where there are substantiated grounds for suspicion, a formal STR must be filed with COAF electronically via its designated system **within 24 hours** of the internal assessment.\n4. **No Tipping-Off:** Under no circumstances shall the customer or any third party be informed (\"tipped off\") that an STR has been filed or is being prepared.

These reserve assets shall be segregated, held in secure and regulated custodial arrangements, and composed primarily of high-quality, low-risk, and liquid instruments to ensure immediate convertibility at par value. Compliance with this policy is mandatory and will be verified through independent audits and regular reporting to the BCB.\n\n## 5.

All assets must be held with regulated custodians (authorized by the BCB or CVM) under clearly designated accounts titled to benefit the stablecoin holders.\n3.  Daily reconciliation must be performed between the total stablecoins in circulation and the fair value of the segregated reserve.\n\n### 5.3 Liquidity Management\n1.

Review and Update Schedule\nThis policy shall be reviewed annually by the Compliance and Risk Management departments to ensure ongoing alignment with BCB regulations, including BCB Circular 4,015 and any subsequent directives specific to stablecoins. Updates will be proposed to the Board of Directors for approval. An ad-hoc review will be triggered by any change in relevant legislation or regulatory guidance.\n\n## 8.

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Brazil\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-01-30T19:30:08.472652\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company currently has no documented policies addressing Brazilian stablecoin regulations, representing a critical compliance gap. All major regulatory requirements are unmet, exposing the company to significant legal, financial, and reputational risks. Immediate action is required to develop Brazil-specific policies, with priority on BCB registration, AML compliance, and consumer protection. The company should not operate in Brazil until at least the critical gaps are addressed and appropriate regulatory approvals are obtained.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Registration with Brazilian Central Bank (BCB) for stablecoin issuers and payment institutions\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy for BCB registration requirements\n\n**Gap:** Company lacks policies addressing mandatory registration with BCB for stablecoin operations in Brazil\n\n**Impact:** Legal prohibition from operating in Brazil, potential fines, and criminal liability for executives\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop BCB registration policy including: 1) Registration categories assessment (payment institution vs. fintech), 2) Application requirements documentation, 3) Ongoing reporting obligations\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance under BCB Resolution 4,893 and Law 9,613/1998\n\n**Current Status:** No Brazil-specific AML policy documented\n\n**Gap:** Missing Brazil-specific AML/CFT policies addressing local regulatory requirements including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting to COAF\n\n**Impact:** Severe regulatory sanctions, business suspension, reputational damage, and potential criminal charges\n\n**Recommendation:** Create Brazil AML policy incorporating: 1) Enhanced due diligence for Brazilian customers, 2) Transaction monitoring thresholds aligned with BCB requirements, 3) COAF reporting procedures, 4) Local compliance officer designation\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Reserve requirements and asset backing for stablecoins (similar to BCB Circular 4,015 for payment institutions)\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish reserve management policy covering: 1) Eligible assets for backing, 2) Segregation requirements, 3) Liquidity ratios, 4) Independent audit procedures, 5) Monthly reporting to BCB\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection under Brazilian Consumer Defense Code (Law 8,078/1990)\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop consumer protection policy including: 1) Portuguese-language disclosures, 2) Complaint handling procedures, 3) Refund and cancellation rights, 4) Data protection aligned with LGPD\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Data protection compliance with LGPD (Brazilian General Data Protection Law)\n\n**Recommendation:** Create LGPD compliance policy covering: 1) Data processing legal bases, 2) Data subject rights procedures, 3) International data transfer mechanisms, 4) DPO appointment and responsibilities, 5) Data breach notification procedures\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **BCB Registration Requirements**: not_met\n❌ **AML/CFT Compliance**: not_met\n❌ **Reserve Requirements**: not_met\n❌ **Consumer Protection**: not_met\n❌ **Data Protection (LGPD)**: not_met\n❌ **Operational Risk Management**: not_met\n❌ **Tax Compliance**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update Summary\nGenerated: 2026-01-30T19:30:48.387560\n\n## Overview\nThis document summarizes proposed updates to company policies and standards
