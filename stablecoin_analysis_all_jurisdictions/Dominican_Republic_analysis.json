This represents a critical risk exposure that requires immediate attention. The highest priority gaps are in legal framework establishment, licensing, AML/CTF compliance, and operational risk management. A comprehensive regulatory research initiative should be launched immediately, followed by systematic policy development and implementation. Given the absence of current policies, the company should not conduct stablecoin operations in the Dominican Republic until these gaps are addressed to avoid severe legal and financial consequences."

This represents a critical risk exposure that requires immediate attention. The highest priority gaps are in legal framework establishment, licensing, AML/CTF compliance, and operational risk management. A comprehensive regulatory research initiative should be launched immediately, followed by systematic policy development and implementation.
