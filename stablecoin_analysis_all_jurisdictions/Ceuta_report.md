# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-12T17:47:38.194867

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits critical compliance deficiencies with no documented policies addressing stablecoin regulatory requirements. Based on standard EU/Spain regulatory frameworks (including MiCA provisions), all essential regulatory domains show non-compliance status. Immediate action is required to develop comprehensive policies, particularly for authorization, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance. The absence of any current policies suggests the company may be operating without necessary regulatory approvals, creating significant legal and financial risks. A phased implementation approach is recommended, starting with critical authorization and reserve policies, followed by consumer protection and operational controls.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance requires authorization from relevant financial authorities (Ceuta likely follows EU/Spain frameworks like MiCA)

**Current Status:** No documented policy for stablecoin issuance authorization

**Gap:** Complete absence of policy addressing regulatory authorization requirements for issuing or operating stablecoins

**Impact:** Potential regulatory enforcement actions, fines, license revocation, and criminal liability for unauthorized financial activities

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive stablecoin issuance policy requiring pre-approval from relevant authorities, including application procedures and compliance monitoring

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must maintain adequate reserves (typically 1:1 liquid assets) with regular independent audits

**Current Status:** No reserve management or audit policy exists

**Gap:** Missing framework for reserve composition, custody, valuation, and independent verification

**Impact:** Risk of insolvency, loss of consumer funds, regulatory sanctions, and loss of market confidence

**Recommendation:** Implement reserve management policy specifying eligible assets, custody arrangements, daily valuation, and quarterly independent audits

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT program for stablecoin operations

**Gap:** Lack of risk-based AML/CFT controls specific to stablecoin transactions and customer onboarding

**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties, potential loss of banking relationships, and reputational damage

**Recommendation:** Develop stablecoin-specific AML/CFT program including KYC procedures, transaction monitoring rules, and SAR reporting protocols

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including redemption rights, disclosures, and complaint handling

**Recommendation:** Establish consumer protection policy with clear redemption procedures, comprehensive disclosures, and formal complaint handling process

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity requirements for payment systems

**Recommendation:** Create operational resilience policy covering system availability, cybersecurity controls, incident response, and business continuity planning
