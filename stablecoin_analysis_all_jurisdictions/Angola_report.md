# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T05:27:07.971495

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no documented policies addressing stablecoin regulation in Angola, representing a complete regulatory gap. All essential regulatory requirements are unmet, creating severe legal, financial, and operational risks. Immediate action is required to: 1) Suspend operations until regulatory research is complete, 2) Engage local legal counsel, 3) Develop comprehensive compliance framework. The company is currently non-compliant with Angolan financial regulations and cannot legally operate stablecoin services in the jurisdiction.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Legal framework for stablecoin issuance and operation in Angola

**Current Status:** No documented policies found

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing stablecoin operations, issuance, redemption, or reserve management in Angola

**Impact:** Company cannot legally operate stablecoin services in Angola; risk of regulatory enforcement, fines, and business shutdown

**Recommendation:** Immediately suspend stablecoin operations in Angola until comprehensive regulatory research is completed and compliant policies are developed

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Licensing requirements for digital asset service providers

**Current Status:** No licensing or authorization policies documented

**Gap:** No policies addressing licensing requirements, application processes, or ongoing compliance with Angolan financial regulatory bodies

**Impact:** Operating without required licenses exposes company to criminal liability, asset seizure, and permanent market exclusion

**Recommendation:** Engage local legal counsel to identify specific licensing requirements from Banco Nacional de Angola and develop licensing application strategy

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance

**Current Status:** No AML/CTF policies specific to Angola

**Gap:** Lack of policies addressing Angola's specific AML/CTF requirements, customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and reporting obligations

**Impact:** Significant financial crime risks, regulatory penalties, and potential criminal prosecution of company officers

**Recommendation:** Develop Angola-specific AML/CTF program aligned with Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards and local regulations

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements

**Recommendation:** Create comprehensive consumer protection framework including clear disclosures, risk warnings, and complaint resolution procedures

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Reserve management and auditing requirements

**Recommendation:** Implement robust reserve management policy with 1:1 backing, regular independent audits, and public transparency reports

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Data protection and privacy compliance

**Recommendation:** Develop data protection policy compliant with Angola's Lei de Proteção de Dados Pessoais and establish data processing agreements

### Gap 4: GAP-008
**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive operational risk management framework including cybersecurity controls and incident response plans
