## Executive Summary
The company currently has no documented policies addressing stablecoin regulatory requirements for South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands jurisdiction. Based on standard financial regulatory frameworks and emerging stablecoin regulations globally, there are critical gaps across all major compliance areas. Immediate action is required to develop comprehensive policies and procedures to address authorization requirements, reserve management, consumer protection, AML/CFT, cybersecurity, and governance. The company should engage legal counsel with expertise in digital asset regulation to conduct thorough jurisdictional analysis and develop a complete compliance program before proceeding with stablecoin operations.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001

### Gap 2: GAP-002

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT policies

**Gap:** Missing anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls required for financial services

**Recommendation:** Establish comprehensive AML/CFT program including KYC procedures, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and staff training

## High Priority Gaps

**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including redemption rights and disclosures

**Recommendation:** Implement consumer protection framework with clear redemption procedures, fee transparency, and comprehensive risk disclosures

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Cybersecurity and operational resilience requirements

**Recommendation:** Develop cybersecurity framework including secure key management, penetration testing, incident response, and business continuity planning

### Gap 3: GAP-006
