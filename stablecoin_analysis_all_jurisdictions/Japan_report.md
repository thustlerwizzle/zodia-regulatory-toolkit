# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-31T06:07:20.248310

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits a complete lack of documented policies and procedures necessary for stablecoin operations in Japan. All regulatory requirements under Japan's Payment Services Act and related financial regulations are currently unmet. This represents a critical compliance failure that prevents legal operation of stablecoin services. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive compliance framework before any market operations can commence. The priority should be addressing licensing requirements, fund segregation, and AML/CTF compliance, as these represent the most immediate barriers to legal operation and carry the highest regulatory risks.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Registration as Electronic Payment Instruments Service Provider under Payment Services Act (PSA)

**Current Status:** No documented policy for regulatory registration

**Gap:** Company lacks policies and procedures for obtaining required licenses to operate stablecoin services in Japan

**Impact:** Operating without proper registration constitutes illegal activity, leading to regulatory enforcement, fines, business suspension, and criminal liability

**Recommendation:** Establish registration framework with Financial Services Agency (FSA), develop licensing roadmap, and implement compliance monitoring for registration requirements

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Segregation of customer funds and stablecoin reserves

**Current Status:** No documented fund segregation policy

**Gap:** Missing policies for separating customer funds from company assets and maintaining adequate reserves

**Impact:** Risk of commingling funds, insufficient reserves, and inability to honor redemptions, leading to customer losses and regulatory sanctions

**Recommendation:** Implement strict fund segregation policies, establish reserve management procedures, and conduct regular audits of reserve adequacy

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance under PSA and Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (FIEA)

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CTF program

**Gap:** Complete absence of customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting procedures

**Impact:** High risk of facilitating illicit financial activities, significant regulatory penalties, and reputational damage

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive AML/CTF program including KYC procedures, transaction monitoring systems, and suspicious activity reporting protocols

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including disclosure requirements

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive disclosure framework, develop clear terms of service, and establish customer complaint handling procedures

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Cybersecurity and operational risk management

**Recommendation:** Establish cybersecurity framework aligned with FSA guidelines, implement multi-signature wallets, cold storage policies, and incident response plans
