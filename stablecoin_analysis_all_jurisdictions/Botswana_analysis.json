Purpose and Scope  \n**Purpose:**  \nThis policy establishes a formal framework for the legal authorization and licensing of stablecoin issuance and operational activities within Botswana. It aims to ensure regulatory clarity, protect consumers, maintain financial stability, and align with national financial regulatory objectives.\n\n**Scope:**  \nThis policy applies to all entities—including domestic and foreign firms—seeking to issue, manage, trade, or facilitate stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies, commodities, or other assets within Botswana’s jurisdiction. It covers both centralized and decentralized models where a legal entity can be identified as having control or oversight.\n\n## 3. Definitions  \n- **Stablecoin:** A digital currency designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified reference asset or basket of assets (e.g., Botswana Pula, USD, gold).  \n- **Issuer:** A legal entity that creates, issues, and manages the stablecoin and holds the reserve assets backing it.  \n- **Operator:** An entity that facilitates stablecoin transactions, trading, custody, or redemption services.  \n- **Bank of Botswana (BoB):** The central bank and primary financial regulatory authority in Botswana.  \n- **Reserve Assets:** The underlying assets held to back the stablecoin’s value, which may include cash, cash equivalents, government securities, or other high-quality liquid assets.  \n- **Applicant:** Any entity seeking a license under this policy.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement  \nIt is the policy of the relevant regulatory authorities in Botswana that no entity may issue or operate stablecoin services without obtaining prior legal authorization and a license from the Bank of Botswana. Licensing will be contingent upon meeting stringent regulatory standards related to financial soundness, consumer protection, anti-money laundering (AML), counter-financing of terrorism (CFT), cybersecurity, and transparency. The Bank of Botswana reserves the right to approve, deny, suspend, or revoke licenses based on compliance with this policy and associated regulations.\n\n## 5. Procedures  \n### 5.1 Licensing Application Process  \n1. **Pre-engagement Consultation:** Prospective applicants must formally engage with the Bank of Botswana’s Fintech Unit to discuss the proposed stablecoin model, scope, and preliminary requirements.  \n2. **Formal Application Submission:** Submit a completed application form along with required documentation, including:  \n   - Business plan and whitepaper  \n   - Legal entity details and governance structure  \n   - Reserve management and custody arrangements  \n   - Risk management framework  \n   - AML/CFT policies  \n   - Technology and cybersecurity audit reports  \n   - Proof of sufficient capital and liquidity  \n3. **Assessment Phase:** BoB will conduct a thorough review, which may include interviews, onsite inspections, and third-party audits.  \n4. **Decision and Issuance:** BoB will issue a decision within 90 business days. If approved, a license with specific conditions will be granted.  \n5. **Post-Licensing Supervision:** Licensees must submit regular reports (e.g., monthly reserve attestations, quarterly compliance reports) and undergo periodic audits.\n\n### 5.2 Regulatory Engagement Strategy  \n- Establish a dedicated BoB Fintech Regulatory Sandbox to pilot stablecoin projects under controlled conditions.  \n- Form a multi-stakeholder committee including BoB, Non-Bank Financial Institutions Regulatory Authority (NBFIRA), and Financial Intelligence Agency (FIA) to oversee policy implementation.  \n- Conduct public consultations and industry workshops to refine licensing criteria.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements  \nLicensees must adhere to the following ongoing requirements:  \n- **Reserve Management:** Maintain 100% backing of stablecoins in circulation with high-quality reserve assets, held in segregated accounts with monthly third-party attestations.  \n- **Transparency:** Publicly disclose reserve composition, audit results, and redemption policies.  \n- **Consumer Protection:** Ensure clear terms of service, redemption rights, and complaint resolution mechanisms.  \n- **AML/CFT Compliance:** Implement robust KYC, transaction monitoring, and reporting systems in line with the Financial Intelligence Act.  \n- **Cybersecurity:** Adhere to national cybersecurity standards and report incidents within 24 hours.  \n- **Capital Adequacy:** Maintain minimum capital as prescribed by BoB based on risk profile.  \n- **Operational Reporting:** Submit quarterly financial statements, incident reports, and annual compliance certifications.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule  \nThis policy will be reviewed annually by the Bank of Botswana in consultation with relevant stakeholders to account for technological developments, market changes, and international regulatory trends. Updates will be published on the BoB website with a 60-day transition period for compliance adjustments.\n\n## 8.
