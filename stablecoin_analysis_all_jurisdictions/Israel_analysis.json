Purpose and Scope\n### Purpose\nThis policy establishes a comprehensive framework to identify, assess, monitor, mitigate, and report on operational risks, with a specific focus on cybersecurity threats inherent in digital asset operations. The policy aims to protect the organization's assets, ensure the integrity of its technology (including smart contracts), maintain business continuity, and comply with applicable regulatory obligations.\n\n### Scope\nThis policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, temporary staff, and third-party service providers (\"Covered Personnel\") involved in the development, deployment, management, or oversight of the organization's technological infrastructure, smart contracts, cryptographic key material, and related operational processes. It encompasses all systems, networks, data, and digital assets owned, operated, or under the custodianship of the organization.\n\n## 3. Definitions\n*   **Operational Risk:** The risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems, or from external events, including legal risk but excluding strategic and reputational risk.\n*   **Smart Contract:** Self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code, deployed on a blockchain or distributed ledger.\n*   **Key Management:** The full lifecycle administration of cryptographic keys, including generation, storage, distribution, rotation, archival, and destruction.\n*   **Access Controls:** Security measures that regulate who or what can view or use resources in a computing environment.\n*   **Incident:** Any unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, destruction, or disruption of services related to information systems or digital assets.\n*   **Business Continuity Planning (BCP):** The process of creating systems of prevention and recovery to deal with potential threats to a company's operations.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\nThe organization is committed to maintaining a robust operational risk management framework that proactively addresses cybersecurity threats. All Covered Personnel are responsible for adhering to the principles and procedures outlined herein to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the organization's systems and data. The framework is built upon four core pillars:\n1.  **Secure Development & Auditing:** Ensuring all smart contracts and critical code are developed securely and undergo rigorous, independent audits.\n2.  **Privileged Access Management:** Implementing stringent controls over cryptographic keys and system access to prevent unauthorized use.\n3.  **Prepared Response:** Maintaining a clear, actionable plan to detect, respond to, contain, and recover from security incidents.\n4.  **Operational Resilience:** Ensuring the organization can maintain or quickly resume mission-critical functions following a disruption.\n\n## 5. Procedures\n\n### 5.1 Smart Contract Security and Auditing\n1.  **Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL):** All smart contract development must follow a defined SDL, which includes requirements for threat modeling, peer code review, and static analysis.\n2.  **Pre-Deployment Audit:** Prior to deployment on any mainnet or production environment, all smart contracts must undergo a formal security audit by at least one reputable, independent third-party auditing firm. Audit scope and criteria must be pre-defined.\n3.  **Audit Findings Remediation:** All critical and high-severity findings from audits must be remediated and re-verified before deployment. Medium and low-severity findings must be formally risk-accepted by the CTO or designated Risk Committee with documented rationale.\n4.  **Post-Deployment Monitoring:** Deployed contracts must be continuously monitored for anomalous activity using dedicated tools. Upgrade mechanisms (e.g., proxies) must themselves be secured and governed by a multi-signature wallet or decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) as appropriate.\n\n### 5.2 Key Management and Access Controls\n1.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Access to systems, databases, and administrative functions must be granted on a need-to-know and need-to-use basis.\n2.  **Multi-Signature Schemes:** Where feasible, control over treasury wallets, governance contracts, and other high-value assets must require multiple authorized signatures (M-of-N) for transaction execution.\n3.  **Secure Storage:** Private keys must never be stored in plaintext. Hardware Security Modules (HSMs), secure enclaves, or reputable multi-party computation (MPC) solutions must be used for root and operational key material. Seed phrases must be stored in geographically distributed, physically secure locations (e.g., safety deposit boxes).\n4.  **Access Logging & Review:** All privileged access must be logged and reviewed quarterly by the Security Team. Any anomalous activity must be reported immediately.\n\n### 5.3 Incident Response Plan\n1.  **Incident Response Team (IRT):** A designated IRT with clearly defined roles (Lead, Communications, Technical, Legal) will be maintained. Contact lists will be updated semi-annually.\n2.  **Classification & Escalation:** Incidents will be classified (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low) based on predefined criteria (impact, scope). A communication and escalation matrix will dictate notification timelines for leadership, regulators, and affected users as required.\n3.  **Containment, Eradication & Recovery:** The IRT will follow documented playbooks to contain the incident, remove the threat, and recover systems to a known good state.\n4.  **Post-Incident Analysis:** A root cause analysis (RCA) report will be completed for all Critical and High incidents, detailing lessons learned and required changes to policies, procedures, or systems.\n\n### 5.4 Business Continuity Planning\n1.  **Business Impact Analysis (BIA):** A BIA will be conducted annually to identify mission-critical systems, processes, and their maximum tolerable downtime (MTD).\n2.  **Recovery Strategies:** Documented strategies for system recovery, data restoration, and alternative operational procedures will be developed based on the BIA. This includes backups of critical data and private key shards.\n3.  **BCP Documentation & Testing:** A formal BCP document will be maintained. Key components of the plan (e.g., failover, communication procedures) will be tested via tabletop exercises at least annually.\n4.  **Communication Plan:** A plan for internal and external communication during a disruption will be maintained, including pre-drafted templates for public disclosure where appropriate.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n*   All Covered Personnel are required to read, understand, and comply with this policy.\n*   Managers are responsible for ensuring their teams comply with relevant procedures.\n*   The Security Team is responsible for monitoring compliance and reporting violations to the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) or equivalent.\n*   Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contracts, and may carry legal or regulatory consequences.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule\nThis policy shall be reviewed and updated at least **annually** by the Security Team and the Legal & Compliance Department. Ad-hoc reviews will be triggered by:\n*   Significant security incidents.\n*   Major changes in the technological or operational environment.\n*   Changes in applicable laws or regulations.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements\nThis policy is designed to align with principles and requirements set forth in relevant financial, data protection, and cybersecurity regulations, including but not limited to:\n*   **NYDFS Cybersecurity Regulation (23 NYCRR 500)**\n*   **Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) Safeguards Rule**\n*   **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**\n*   **ISO/IEC 27001:2022 (Information security management systems)**\n*   **Future applicable regulations** pertaining to digital assets, operational resilience (e.g., DORA in the EU), and cybersecurity.\n\n*Policy Version: 1.0  \nEffective Date: [Date]  \nApproved By: [Chief Executive Officer / Board of Directors]*\n```"

Purpose and Scope\n### Purpose\nThis policy establishes a comprehensive framework to identify, assess, monitor, mitigate, and report on operational risks, with a specific focus on cybersecurity threats inherent in digital asset operations. The policy aims to protect the organization's assets, ensure the integrity of its technology (including smart contracts), maintain business continuity, and comply with applicable regulatory obligations.\n\n### Scope\nThis policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, temporary staff, and third-party service providers (\"Covered Personnel\") involved in the development, deployment, management, or oversight of the organization's technological infrastructure, smart contracts, cryptographic key material, and related operational processes. It encompasses all systems, networks, data, and digital assets owned, operated, or under the custodianship of the organization.\n\n## 3. Definitions\n*   **Operational Risk:** The risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems, or from external events, including legal risk but excluding strategic and reputational risk.\n*   **Smart Contract:** Self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code, deployed on a blockchain or distributed ledger.\n*   **Key Management:** The full lifecycle administration of cryptographic keys, including generation, storage, distribution, rotation, archival, and destruction.\n*   **Access Controls:** Security measures that regulate who or what can view or use resources in a computing environment.\n*   **Incident:** Any unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, destruction, or disruption of services related to information systems or digital assets.\n*   **Business Continuity Planning (BCP):** The process of creating systems of prevention and recovery to deal with potential threats to a company's operations.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\nThe organization is committed to maintaining a robust operational risk management framework that proactively addresses cybersecurity threats. All Covered Personnel are responsible for adhering to the principles and procedures outlined herein to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the organization's systems and data. The framework is built upon four core pillars:\n1.  **Secure Development & Auditing:** Ensuring all smart contracts and critical code are developed securely and undergo rigorous, independent audits.\n2.  **Privileged Access Management:** Implementing stringent controls over cryptographic keys and system access to prevent unauthorized use.\n3.  **Prepared Response:** Maintaining a clear, actionable plan to detect, respond to, contain, and recover from security incidents.\n4.  **Operational Resilience:** Ensuring the organization can maintain or quickly resume mission-critical functions following a disruption.\n\n## 5. Procedures\n\n### 5.1 Smart Contract Security and Auditing\n1.  **Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL):** All smart contract development must follow a defined SDL, which includes requirements for threat modeling, peer code review, and static analysis.\n2.  **Pre-Deployment Audit:** Prior to deployment on any mainnet or production environment, all smart contracts must undergo a formal security audit by at least one reputable, independent third-party auditing firm. Audit scope and criteria must be pre-defined.\n3.  **Audit Findings Remediation:** All critical and high-severity findings from audits must be remediated and re-verified before deployment. Medium and low-severity findings must be formally risk-accepted by the CTO or designated Risk Committee with documented rationale.\n4.  **Post-Deployment Monitoring:** Deployed contracts must be continuously monitored for anomalous activity using dedicated tools. Upgrade mechanisms (e.g., proxies) must themselves be secured and governed by a multi-signature wallet or decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) as appropriate.\n\n### 5.2 Key Management and Access Controls\n1.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Access to systems, databases, and administrative functions must be granted on a need-to-know and need-to-use basis.\n2.  **Multi-Signature Schemes:** Where feasible, control over treasury wallets, governance contracts, and other high-value assets must require multiple authorized signatures (M-of-N) for transaction execution.\n3.  **Secure Storage:** Private keys must never be stored in plaintext. Hardware Security Modules (HSMs), secure enclaves, or reputable multi-party computation (MPC) solutions must be used for root and operational key material. Seed phrases must be stored in geographically distributed, physically secure locations (e.g., safety deposit boxes).\n4.  **Access Logging & Review:** All privileged access must be logged and reviewed quarterly by the Security Team. Any anomalous activity must be reported immediately.\n\n### 5.3 Incident Response Plan\n1.  **Incident Response Team (IRT):** A designated IRT with clearly defined roles (Lead, Communications, Technical, Legal) will be maintained. Contact lists will be updated semi-annually.\n2.  **Classification & Escalation:** Incidents will be classified (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low) based on predefined criteria (impact, scope). A communication and escalation matrix will dictate notification timelines for leadership, regulators, and affected users as required.\n3.  **Containment, Eradication & Recovery:** The IRT will follow documented playbooks to contain the incident, remove the threat, and recover systems to a known good state.\n4.  **Post-Incident Analysis:** A root cause analysis (RCA) report will be completed for all Critical and High incidents, detailing lessons learned and required changes to policies, procedures, or systems.\n\n### 5.4 Business Continuity Planning\n1.  **Business Impact Analysis (BIA):** A BIA will be conducted annually to identify mission-critical systems, processes, and their maximum tolerable downtime (MTD).\n2.  **Recovery Strategies:** Documented strategies for system recovery, data restoration, and alternative operational procedures will be developed based on the BIA. This includes backups of critical data and private key shards.\n3.  **BCP Documentation & Testing:** A formal BCP document will be maintained. Key components of the plan (e.g., failover, communication procedures) will be tested via tabletop exercises at least annually.\n4.  **Communication Plan:** A plan for internal and external communication during a disruption will be maintained, including pre-drafted templates for public disclosure where appropriate.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n*   All Covered Personnel are required to read, understand, and comply with this policy.\n*   Managers are responsible for ensuring their teams comply with relevant procedures.\n*   The Security Team is responsible for monitoring compliance and reporting violations to the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) or equivalent.\n*   Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contracts, and may carry legal or regulatory consequences.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule\nThis policy shall be reviewed and updated at least **annually** by the Security Team and the Legal & Compliance Department. Ad-hoc reviews will be triggered by:\n*   Significant security incidents.\n*   Major changes in the technological or operational environment.\n*   Changes in applicable laws or regulations.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements\nThis policy is designed to align with principles and requirements set forth in relevant financial, data protection, and cybersecurity regulations, including but not limited to:\n*   **NYDFS Cybersecurity Regulation (23 NYCRR 500)**\n*   **Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) Safeguards Rule**\n*   **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**\n*   **ISO/IEC 27001:2022 (Information security management systems)**\n*   **Future applicable regulations** pertaining to digital assets, operational resilience (e.g., DORA in the EU), and cybersecurity.\n\n*Policy Version: 1.0  \nEffective Date: [Date]  \nApproved By: [Chief Executive Officer / Board of Directors]*\n```"

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Israel\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-01-31T05:49:21.766833\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company exhibits complete non-compliance with Israeli stablecoin regulatory requirements. No documented policies exist to address any of the core regulatory obligations. This represents an extreme compliance risk that requires immediate and comprehensive remediation. The company should cease any stablecoin-related operations until foundational compliance frameworks are established and engage with Israeli regulators to understand specific requirements. Priority should be given to authorization/licensing, reserve management, and AML/CTF compliance, as these represent the most critical regulatory expectations with the highest potential impact if unaddressed.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Authorization/Licensing for stablecoin issuance in Israel\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found\n\n**Gap:** Company lacks any documented policy addressing the regulatory requirement for obtaining proper authorization or licensing to issue stablecoins in Israel. The Bank of Israel has indicated stablecoins fall under payment service regulation.\n\n**Impact:** Operating without proper authorization could result in regulatory enforcement actions, fines, cease-and-desist orders, and reputational damage.\n\n**Recommendation:** Immediately establish a policy requiring regulatory authorization assessment before any stablecoin issuance. Engage with Bank of Israel's Payment Systems Division to understand licensing requirements.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Reserve requirements and asset backing for stablecoins\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found\n\n**Gap:** No policy exists regarding reserve composition, custody, auditing, or transparency for stablecoin backing assets. Israeli regulators expect stablecoins to be fully backed by high-quality liquid assets.\n\n**Impact:** Failure to maintain adequate reserves could lead to loss of peg, consumer harm, regulatory intervention, and potential insolvency proceedings.\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive reserve management policy including: 1) Asset composition requirements, 2) Segregated custody arrangements, 3) Regular third-party audits, 4) Public disclosure of reserve composition.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found\n\n**Gap:** No specific AML/CTF policy for stablecoin operations. Israel's AML regulations apply to virtual asset service providers, requiring KYC, transaction monitoring, and reporting obligations.\n\n**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties, potential criminal liability, loss of banking relationships, and inclusion on regulatory watchlists.\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive AML/CTF program including: 1) Customer identification and verification procedures, 2) Transaction monitoring systems, 3) Suspicious activity reporting protocols, 4) Designated compliance officer.\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements\n\n**Recommendation:** Create consumer protection policy covering: 1) Clear risk disclosures, 2) Redemption rights and procedures, 3) Complaint resolution mechanisms, 4) Privacy and data protection measures.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop operational risk framework including: 1) Smart contract security and auditing procedures, 2) Key management and access controls, 3) Incident response plan, 4) Business continuity planning.\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **authorization_licensing**: not_met\n❌ **reserve_requirements**: not_met\n❌ **aml_ctf_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **consumer_protection**: not_met\n❌ **operational_risk**: not_met\n❌ **reporting_transparency**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update Summary\nGenerated: 2026-01-31T05:49:59.667394\n\n## Overview\nThis document summarizes proposed updates to company policies and standards based on regulatory gap analysis.\n\n## New Policies Required\n\n## Modified Policies\n\n### GAP-001\n**Category:** Compliance\n**Current Policy:** No documented policy found\n**Proposed Change:** Immediately establish a policy requiring regulatory authorization assessment before any stablecoin issuance.
