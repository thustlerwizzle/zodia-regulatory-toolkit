All regulatory requirements are completely unmet, creating severe legal, operational, and reputational risks. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive compliance framework. The most critical gaps requiring immediate attention are registration/licensing and AML/CFT compliance, as operating without these could result in immediate regulatory shutdown and criminal liability. A phased implementation approach is recommended, starting with foundational policies (registration, AML/CFT) before addressing operational and consumer protection requirements."

Purpose and Scope\n### Purpose\nThis policy establishes a comprehensive Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CFT) program to ensure compliance with Argentine regulatory requirements, specifically those mandated by the Unidad de Información Financiera (UIF). The program is designed to detect, prevent, and report money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit financial activities related to stablecoin transactions.\n\n### Scope\nThis policy applies to all employees, contractors, directors, and agents of the organization involved in the issuance, redemption, exchange, transfer, or custody of stablecoins. It covers all customer relationships and transactions, including both fiat-to-stablecoin and stablecoin-to-stablecoin operations.\n\n## 3.

All personnel are required to adhere to the procedures outlined in this document. Non-compliance will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination, and may lead to regulatory penalties.\n\n## 5. Procedures\n\n### 5.1. Customer Identification Program (CIP)\n1.  **Identity Verification:** Before establishing a business relationship or conducting a transaction above a threshold defined in internal procedures, the identity of the customer (natural or legal person) must be verified using reliable, independent source documents, data, or information.\n2.  **Required Information for Individuals:** Full legal name, date of birth, nationality, government-issued identification number (DNI, passport), and residential address.\n3.  **Required Information for Legal Entities:** Legal name, business address, principal place of business, government registration number, and identification of beneficial owners (individuals owning 10% or more) and controlling persons.\n4.  **Record Retention:** Copies of all identification documents and records of verification must be maintained for a minimum of ten (10) years from the date the account is closed or the transaction is completed, as required by UIF regulations.\n\n### 5.2.

Transaction Monitoring System\n1.  **Automated System:** An automated transaction monitoring system will be implemented to screen all stablecoin transactions in real-time and retrospectively.\n2.  **Monitoring Parameters:** The system will be calibrated to detect patterns indicative of suspicious activity, such as structuring (breaking down large transactions), rapid movement of funds, transactions with high-risk jurisdictions, or activity inconsistent with a customer's profile.\n3.  **Alert Review:** Designated Compliance Personnel will investigate all system-generated alerts. A clear audit trail of the review and resolution of each alert will be maintained.\n\n### 5.4.

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Argentina\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-01-30T05:41:02.685651\n\n## Executive Summary\nCRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no documented policies addressing Argentine stablecoin regulations. All regulatory requirements are completely unmet, creating severe legal, operational, and reputational risks. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive compliance framework. The most critical gaps requiring immediate attention are registration/licensing and AML/CFT compliance, as operating without these could result in immediate regulatory shutdown and criminal liability. A phased implementation approach is recommended, starting with foundational policies (registration, AML/CFT) before addressing operational and consumer protection requirements.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Registration/Licensing: Argentina's BCRA (Central Bank) requires entities issuing or operating with stablecoins to obtain proper authorization and registration.\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy for regulatory registration or licensing requirements\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policy addressing mandatory registration with BCRA for stablecoin operations\n\n**Impact:** Legal prohibition of operations, severe penalties, potential criminal liability, and business shutdown\n\n**Recommendation:** Immediately develop and implement a regulatory registration policy that includes: 1) BCRA registration process, 2) ongoing compliance monitoring, 3) record-keeping requirements, 4) designated compliance officer responsibilities\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** AML/CFT Compliance: Argentina's UIF (Financial Information Unit) requires comprehensive anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing programs for stablecoin operations.\n\n**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT policies or procedures\n\n**Gap:** Missing entire AML/CFT framework including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and record retention\n\n**Impact:** Significant regulatory fines, criminal prosecution, loss of banking relationships, and reputational damage\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive AML/CFT program including: 1) Customer Identification Program (CIP), 2) Enhanced Due Diligence for high-risk customers, 3) Transaction monitoring system, 4) Suspicious Activity Reporting procedures, 5) Employee training program\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Reserve Requirements: Stablecoin issuers must maintain adequate reserves in Argentine pesos or approved foreign currency, with regular auditing and reporting.\n\n**Recommendation:** Create reserve management policy covering: 1) Minimum reserve requirements, 2) Custody arrangements, 3) Quarterly independent audits, 4) Regulatory reporting templates, 5) Reserve transparency disclosures\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer Protection: Requirements for clear disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling mechanisms for stablecoin users.\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement consumer protection framework including: 1) Clear terms of service, 2) Redemption policy, 3) Complaint handling procedures, 4) Risk disclosure statements, 5) User education materials\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-006\n**Requirement:** Data Protection: Compliance with Argentina's Personal Data Protection Law (Law 25.326) for user data handling.\n\n**Recommendation:** Create comprehensive data protection policy aligned with Law 25.326 including: 1) Data processing principles, 2) User consent mechanisms, 3) Data security measures, 4) Data breach response plan, 5) User rights procedures\n\n### Gap 4: GAP-007\n**Requirement:** Operational Risk Management: BCRA expectations for robust operational risk frameworks including cybersecurity and business continuity.\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish operational risk management framework including: 1) Cybersecurity policy, 2) Business continuity plan, 3) Disaster recovery procedures, 4) Regular risk assessments, 5) Incident response plan\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **registration_licensing**: not_met\n❌ **aml_cft_compliance**: not_met\n❌
