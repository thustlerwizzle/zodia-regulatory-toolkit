Policy Title\nLegal Compliance Framework and Interim Suspension of Stablecoin Operations Involving the Jurisdiction of South Ossetia\n\n## 2. Purpose and Scope\n\n### 2.1 Purpose\nThis policy establishes a mandatory legal compliance process and an immediate, temporary suspension of all stablecoin-related activities involving South Ossetia. The purpose is to mitigate legal, regulatory, and reputational risks arising from the absence of a confirmed regulatory framework for stablecoins within South Ossetian jurisdiction. This policy ensures the organization operates prudently by confirming legal permissibility and obtaining necessary authorizations before engaging in any regulated financial activity in this region.\n\n### 2.2 Scope\nThis policy applies globally to all subsidiaries, business units, employees, contractors, and agents of [Organization Name] involved in:\n*   Issuance, redemption, trading, or exchange of stablecoins.\n*   Provision of wallet, custody, or transfer services for stablecoins.\n*   Any financial service or product where the counterparty, user, or transaction is identified as being based in, originating from, or legally governed by the laws of South Ossetia.\n\n## 3.

Policy Statement\n\n[Organization Name] is committed to the highest standards of legal compliance and regulatory adherence in all jurisdictions where it operates. Due to the current absence of a confirmed and specific regulatory framework for stablecoin operations within South Ossetia, the organization mandates an immediate and full suspension of all activities involving this jurisdiction.\n\nNo new operations, services, or customer onboarding involving South Ossetia shall commence. Existing operations, if any, shall be suspended in an orderly manner. Operations may only resume after a formal legal review confirms the applicable regulatory framework and the organization has secured all necessary licenses or authorizations from the relevant South Ossetian authorities.\n\n## 5. Procedures\n\n### 5.1 Immediate Suspension (Effective Immediately)\n1.  **Identification & Notification:** The Compliance Department will identify all existing services, users, or transaction flows involving South Ossetia. Affected business units and customers will be notified of the suspension in accordance with applicable terms of service.\n2.  **Technical Implementation:** The Technology Department will implement geo-blocking and IP address restrictions to prevent access to stablecoin services from within South Ossetia.\n3.  **Transaction Halt:** The Operations Department will halt the processing of all deposits, withdrawals, trades, and transfers identified as originating from or destined for South Ossetian users or entities.\n\n### 5.2 Legal Research and Framework Analysis\n1.  **Engagement of Counsel:** The Legal Department will, within 30 days of this policy's effective date, engage qualified local legal counsel in South Ossetia.\n2.  **Research Mandate:** Instructed counsel will provide a formal written opinion addressing:\n    *   The legal status of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins.\n    *   Specific licensing requirements for issuance, exchange, and custody.\n    *   Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (CFT) obligations.\n    *   Capital, reserve, and consumer protection requirements.\n    *   Tax treatment and reporting duties.\n    *   The legality of offering services cross-border into South Ossetia.\n3.  **Risk Assessment:** The Legal and Compliance departments will jointly assess the counsel's findings to determine legal permissibility and associated risks.\n\n### 5.3 Resumption of Operations (Conditional)\n1.  **Approval to Proceed:** Resumption of operations is contingent upon written approval from the Chief Legal Officer and the Head of Compliance.\n2.  **Licensing:** If required, the organization must successfully obtain all necessary licenses from South Ossetian regulatory bodies before any service is restored.\n3.  **Policy & Control Update:** Prior to resumption, all relevant internal policies (AML/KYC, Risk, Technology) must be updated to incorporate South Ossetia-specific requirements.\n4.  **Phased Rollout:** Any resumption will be conducted in a controlled, phased manner, subject to ongoing monitoring.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n\n*   **Mandatory Adherence:** All personnel must comply fully with this suspension order. Circumventing geo-blocks or processing transactions for South Ossetian counterparts is strictly prohibited.\n*   **Reporting Obligation:** Employees must immediately report any suspected or attempted activity in violation of this suspension to the Compliance Department.\n*   **Documentation:** All steps taken to enact the suspension, the legal counsel's research, license applications, and resumption plans must be thoroughly documented and archived.\n*   **Consequences for Violation:** Violation of this policy will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contract, and may be reported to relevant authorities.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule\n\nThis policy shall be reviewed **annually** by the Legal and Compliance departments. An ad-hoc review will be triggered immediately upon:\n*   Receipt of the formal legal opinion from South Ossetian counsel.\n*   Notification of any change in South Ossetian financial or digital asset regulation.\n*   A decision to apply for or obtain a regulatory license.\n*   The resumption of any operations in the jurisdiction.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements\n\nThis policy is enacted proactively in response to the following regulatory principles and uncertainties:\n\n*   **Principle of Legal Certainty:** Operating a financial service without a clear legal basis poses existential legal and reputational risk.\n*   **General Licensing Mandates:** Most jurisdictions require formal licensing for entities engaged in money transmission, e-money issuance, or financial exchange, which likely encompasses stablecoin activities.\n*   **AML/CFT Frameworks (e.g., FATF Recommendations):** Requires regulated entities to understand and implement local customer due diligence and reporting obligations, which cannot be done without clarity on the local framework.\n*   **Consumer Protection Mandates:** The absence of a known framework prevents the organization from ensuring adequate disclosures, recourse mechanisms, and reserve protections for South Ossetian users.\n\n*This policy is informed by a precautionary approach to common global financial regulatory standards, pending the clarification of South Ossetia's specific stablecoin regulations.*\n```"

Due to the current absence of a confirmed and specific regulatory framework for stablecoin operations within South Ossetia, the organization mandates an immediate and full suspension of all activities involving this jurisdiction.\n\nNo new operations, services, or customer onboarding involving South Ossetia shall commence. Existing operations, if any, shall be suspended in an orderly manner. Operations may only resume after a formal legal review confirms the applicable regulatory framework and the organization has secured all necessary licenses or authorizations from the relevant South Ossetian authorities.\n\n## 5. Procedures\n\n### 5.1 Immediate Suspension (Effective Immediately)\n1.  **Identification & Notification:** The Compliance Department will identify all existing services, users, or transaction flows involving South Ossetia. Affected business units and customers will be notified of the suspension in accordance with applicable terms of service.\n2.  **Technical Implementation:** The Technology Department will implement geo-blocking and IP address restrictions to prevent access to stablecoin services from within South Ossetia.\n3.  **Transaction Halt:** The Operations Department will halt the processing of all deposits, withdrawals, trades, and transfers identified as originating from or destined for South Ossetian users or entities.\n\n### 5.2 Legal Research and Framework Analysis\n1.  **Engagement of Counsel:** The Legal Department will, within 30 days of this policy's effective date, engage qualified local legal counsel in South Ossetia.\n2.  **Research Mandate:** Instructed counsel will provide a formal written opinion addressing:\n    *   The legal status of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins.\n    *   Specific licensing requirements for issuance, exchange, and custody.\n    *   Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (CFT) obligations.\n    *   Capital, reserve, and consumer protection requirements.\n    *   Tax treatment and reporting duties.\n    *   The legality of offering services cross-border into South Ossetia.\n3.  **Risk Assessment:** The Legal and Compliance departments will jointly assess the counsel's findings to determine legal permissibility and associated risks.\n\n### 5.3 Resumption of Operations (Conditional)\n1.  **Approval to Proceed:** Resumption of operations is contingent upon written approval from the Chief Legal Officer and the Head of Compliance.\n2.  **Licensing:** If required, the organization must successfully obtain all necessary licenses from South Ossetian regulatory bodies before any service is restored.\n3.  **Policy & Control Update:** Prior to resumption, all relevant internal policies (AML/KYC, Risk, Technology) must be updated to incorporate South Ossetia-specific requirements.\n4.  **Phased Rollout:** Any resumption will be conducted in a controlled, phased manner, subject to ongoing monitoring.\n\n## 6.

References to Regulatory Requirements\n\nThis policy is enacted proactively in response to the following regulatory principles and uncertainties:\n\n*   **Principle of Legal Certainty:** Operating a financial service without a clear legal basis poses existential legal and reputational risk.\n*   **General Licensing Mandates:** Most jurisdictions require formal licensing for entities engaged in money transmission, e-money issuance, or financial exchange, which likely encompasses stablecoin activities.\n*   **AML/CFT Frameworks (e.g., FATF Recommendations):** Requires regulated entities to understand and implement local customer due diligence and reporting obligations, which cannot be done without clarity on the local framework.\n*   **Consumer Protection Mandates:** The absence of a known framework prevents the organization from ensuring adequate disclosures, recourse mechanisms, and reserve protections for South Ossetian users.\n\n*This policy is informed by a precautionary approach to common global financial regulatory standards, pending the clarification of South Ossetia's specific stablecoin regulations.*\n```"
