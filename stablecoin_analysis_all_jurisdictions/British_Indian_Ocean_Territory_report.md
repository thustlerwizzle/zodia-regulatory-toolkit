## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no documented policies addressing fundamental regulatory requirements for stablecoin operations in the British Indian Ocean Territory or any jurisdiction. All core regulatory areas show 'not met' status, indicating the company is operating without any compliance framework. Immediate action is required to develop and implement comprehensive policies across all regulatory domains before continuing operations. The highest priority gaps relate to legal authorization, reserve management, and AML/CTF compliance, which carry the most severe regulatory and financial risks.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Legal authorization to issue stablecoins in British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT)

**Current Status:** No policy exists regarding jurisdictional authorization

**Gap:** Company lacks any policy addressing whether it is legally authorized to operate stablecoin services in BIOT. No jurisdictional risk assessment or licensing framework is documented.

**Impact:** Operating without proper authorization could result in regulatory enforcement actions, fines, license revocation, and reputational damage.

**Recommendation:** Immediately suspend any stablecoin operations in BIOT until legal counsel confirms authorization requirements. Develop a Jurisdictional Authorization Policy that includes: 1) Legal assessment process for new jurisdictions, 2) Licensing requirements documentation, 3) Regulatory engagement protocol.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Stablecoin reserve requirements and backing asset standards

**Current Status:** No documented reserve management or asset backing policies

**Gap:** No policies exist regarding reserve composition, custody arrangements, audit requirements, or redemption mechanisms for stablecoins.

**Impact:** Failure to maintain adequate reserves could lead to insolvency, loss of peg, consumer harm, and regulatory sanctions including cease-and-desist orders.

**Recommendation:** Develop a Comprehensive Reserve Management Policy including: 1) Minimum reserve requirements (e.g., 100% backing), 2) Permissible asset types and concentration limits, 3) Independent custody arrangements, 4) Monthly attestation/audit requirements, 5) Redemption procedures and timelines.

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance

**Current Status:** No AML/CTF policies documented

**Gap:** Complete absence of AML/CTF framework including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and record-keeping.

**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties, criminal liability for money laundering facilitation, loss of banking relationships, and potential business closure.

**Recommendation:** Implement a full AML/CTF Program including: 1) Risk-based customer identification and verification (KYC), 2) Ongoing transaction monitoring, 3) Suspicious activity reporting procedures, 4) Designated compliance officer, 5) Regular employee training, 6) Independent testing program.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements

**Recommendation:** Develop Consumer Protection Framework including: 1) Clear terms of service and user agreements, 2) Prominent risk disclosures about stablecoin mechanics, 3) Transparent fee schedule, 4) Formal complaint handling process, 5) Dispute resolution mechanism.

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity standards

**Recommendation:** Establish Operational Resilience Program including: 1) Business continuity and disaster recovery plans, 2) Cybersecurity framework (NIST or equivalent), 3) Incident response protocol, 4) Regular penetration testing, 5) System availability targets and monitoring.

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Governance and risk management framework

**Recommendation:** Implement Governance Framework including: 1) Board-level compliance committee, 2) Chief Compliance Officer appointment, 3) Regular risk assessments, 4) Internal audit function, 5) Whistleblower policy, 6) Code of conduct.
