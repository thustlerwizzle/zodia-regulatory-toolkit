## Regulatory Requirements Summary

### **Regulatory Compliance Summary: OKX EU Stablecoin Payment Card**

**Subject:** Launch of a cryptocurrency-linked payment card within the European Union, issued by a regulated entity.

---

#### **1. Key Regulatory Requirements & Framework**
*   **E-Money Institution (EMI) Licensing:** The card's issuance via **Monavate**, a UK-authorized E-Money Institution, is the core regulatory mechanism. This requires Monavate to comply with the EU's **Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2)** and relevant e-money regulations (EMD2 at EU level, transposed nationally).
*   **Anti-Money Laundering (AML) & Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF):** Strict adherence to the EU's **AML/CFT Directive (6AMLD)** is mandatory. This encompasses Customer Due Diligence (CDD), Know Your Customer (KYC), transaction monitoring, and reporting suspicious activities.
*   **Travel Rule Compliance:** For the underlying crypto transactions funding the card, OKX must comply with the "Travel Rule" (similar to FATF Recommendation 16), requiring the sharing of originator and beneficiary information for transfers.
*   **Consumer Protection & Transparency:** Compliance with the **Payment Accounts Directive (PAD)** and general EU consumer law is required. This includes clear pricing, terms & conditions, and robust complaint handling procedures.

#### **2. Primary Compliance Obligations**
*   **Issuer (Monavate):** Holds primary responsibility for safeguarding user funds (required to hold client funds in segregated accounts), ensuring the technical operation of the card program, and meeting all PSD2/EMI obligations.
*   **Crypto Exchange (OKX):** Must conduct rigorous **KYC/AML verification** on all EU users before card access is granted. It is responsible for the secure conversion of USDC/USDG to fiat currency (likely EUR) and ensuring the sourcing of funds complies with AML regulations.
*   **Partnership Oversight:** Both entities require a clear contractual framework outlining compliance responsibilities, data sharing protocols (under GDPR), and liability in case of regulatory breach or operational failure.

#### **3. Recent Regulatory Changes & Context**
*   **Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA):** This imminent EU-wide framework (progressive application from 2024) is the most significant recent change. While e-money provisions are already in force, MiCA will directly regulate **asset-referenced tokens (ARTs)** and **e-money tokens (EMTs)** like USDC. This launch positions OKX within a regulated structure ahead of MiCA's full implementation, ensuring future compliance for stablecoin offerings.
*   **Focus on Stablecoins:** Regulators globally are intensifying scrutiny on stablecoin issuers and their integration into payment systems. Using a regulated EMI issuer demonstrates a proactive compliance approach.

#### **4. Jurisdiction-Specific Requirements**
*   **European Union:** The card's availability is contingent on compliance with the national implementation of PSD2, AML directives, and e-money rules in each **EU member state** where it is offered. Monavate's UK authorization is valid in the EU via passporting rights or equivalent post-Brexit arrangements.
*   **United Kingdom:** As Monavate is UK-regulated, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) oversees its activities, requiring compliance with the UK's **Financial Services and Markets Act (FSMA)** regime and its AML regulations.

#### **5. Enforcement Actions & Regulatory Guidance**
*   **Enforcement Context:** Regulatory actions in the EU/UK have recently targeted:
    *   **Inadequate KYC/AML controls** at crypto exchanges.
    *   **Unauthorized issuance of payment instruments or e-money.**
    *   **Misleading marketing** of crypto-asset services.
*   **Relevant Guidance:**
    *   The **European Banking Authority (EBA)** and **European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA)** have issued consistent guidance on the application of AML rules to crypto-assets.
    *   The **FCA's** robust crypto-asset marketing regime underscores the need for clear, fair, and non-misleading communications around such cards.
    *   The card's launch via a fully regulated issuer directly addresses a key area of regulatory concern: bringing crypto-to-fiat payment services within the perimeter of existing financial regulation.

---

**Conclusion:** OKX's launch strategy exemplifies a compliance-first approach to crypto payments in the EU. By partnering with a fully licensed E-Money Institution (Monavate) and leveraging established card network infrastructure (Mastercard), the service operates within the well-defined regulatory frameworks of PSD2 and AML directives. This model proactively addresses current enforcement priorities and aligns with the forthcoming MiCA regulation, mitigating significant legal and operational risks.


# Gap Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE GAP: No company policies were provided for analysis, making it impossible to verify compliance with any regulatory requirements. The current status indicates complete inability to assess OKX's policy framework for its EU stablecoin payment card launch. This represents an extreme compliance risk as regulatory frameworks require documented policies, procedures, and controls. Immediate action is required to develop and implement comprehensive compliance policies addressing all identified regulatory requirements. The partnership with regulated entities (Monavate, Mastercard) provides some structural compliance, but without documented internal policies, OKX remains exposed to significant regulatory, operational, and reputational risks across all EU jurisdictions.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** PSD2/EMD2 compliance for E-Money Institution operations including safeguarding user funds in segregated accounts

**Current Status:** No company policies provided for review

**Gap:** Unable to verify if OKX has documented policies ensuring Monavate's compliance with PSD2/EMD2 requirements, fund segregation protocols, and partnership oversight mechanisms

**Impact:** Risk of regulatory sanctions, loss of EMI licensing for Monavate, potential loss of customer funds, and service suspension across EU markets

**Recommendation:** Develop and implement comprehensive partnership oversight policy documenting Monavate's PSD2/EMD2 compliance verification procedures, fund segregation audits, and liability frameworks

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** EU AML/CFT Directive (6AMLD) compliance including CDD, KYC, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting

**Current Status:** No company policies provided for review

**Gap:** Cannot confirm existence of EU-specific AML/CFT policies aligned with 6AMLD requirements, including risk-based approach documentation, enhanced due diligence procedures, and reporting mechanisms to EU financial intelligence units

**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties, potential criminal liability for money laundering violations, service restrictions, and reputational damage

**Recommendation:** Create EU-specific AML/CFT policy manual incorporating 6AMLD requirements, establish EU transaction monitoring system, and implement EU financial intelligence unit reporting protocols

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Travel Rule compliance for crypto transactions funding the card (FATF Recommendation 16 equivalent)

**Recommendation:** Develop Travel Rule compliance policy specific to EU card funding transactions, implement secure information sharing infrastructure, and establish audit trails for all transfers

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Payment Accounts Directive (PAD) and EU consumer protection requirements including clear pricing, terms, and complaint handling

**Recommendation:** Establish EU consumer protection policy compliant with PAD, implement standardized fee disclosure templates, create EU-specific complaint handling procedures with mandated resolution timelines

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** MiCA compliance for e-money tokens (EMTs) like USDC/USDG

**Recommendation:** Develop MiCA readiness policy focusing on EMT requirements, establish stablecoin reserve management procedures, and create MiCA compliance roadmap with implementation timeline

### Gap 4: GAP-006
**Requirement:** GDPR compliance for data sharing between OKX and Monavate

**Recommendation:** Create GDPR-compliant data sharing policy with Monavate, establish data processing agreements, implement privacy-by-design in card operations, and document lawful bases for all data transfers
