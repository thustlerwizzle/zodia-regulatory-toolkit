## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no documented policies addressing stablecoin regulation in Equatorial Guinea, representing a complete regulatory compliance failure. All identified regulatory requirements are unmet, creating severe legal, financial, and operational risks. Immediate action is required to suspend operations in this jurisdiction until comprehensive regulatory research can be completed and a full compliance framework established. The highest priority gaps relate to legal authorization to operate, licensing, and AML/CTF compliance, which could result in criminal liability if not addressed immediately.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Licensing requirements for digital asset service providers

**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements

**Recommendation:** Create consumer protection policy including clear risk disclosures, terms of service, and complaint resolution procedures

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Reserve management and auditing requirements for stablecoin issuers

**Recommendation:** Establish reserve management policy with clear asset backing requirements, custody standards, and regular independent audits
