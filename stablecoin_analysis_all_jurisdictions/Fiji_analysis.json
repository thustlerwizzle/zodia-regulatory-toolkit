Immediate action is required to address fundamental gaps in licensing, AML/CTF, reserve management, and consumer protection before any operational activities can commence. The current state poses severe legal, financial, and reputational risks. A phased compliance program should begin with legal authorization and AML framework development as immediate priorities, followed by operational and consumer protection policies.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Legal authorization/licensing for stablecoin issuance and operation in Fiji\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing the legal framework for operating stablecoin services in Fiji. No licensing procedures, regulatory engagement protocols, or legal authorization requirements documented.\n\n**Impact:** Operating without proper authorization could result in regulatory enforcement actions, fines, license revocation, criminal liability, and reputational damage.\n\n**Recommendation:** Immediately engage Fijian legal counsel to determine applicable regulations under the Reserve Bank of Fiji Act, Financial Transactions Reporting Act, and any emerging digital asset frameworks.
