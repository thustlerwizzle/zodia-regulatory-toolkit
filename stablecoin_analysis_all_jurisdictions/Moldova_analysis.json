This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Moldova\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-02-06T03:32:12.666215\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company exhibits a complete absence of documented policies for stablecoin operations in Moldova, representing critical non-compliance with fundamental regulatory requirements. All identified regulatory areas show 'not met' status. Immediate action is required to develop comprehensive compliance frameworks before any stablecoin operations can commence. The highest priority gaps relate to licensing, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance, which carry the most severe regulatory consequences. The company should consider engaging specialized legal and compliance expertise familiar with Moldova's financial regulatory landscape and emerging digital asset frameworks.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Legal authorization/licensing for stablecoin issuance and operations\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing licensing requirements for stablecoin operations in Moldova. No framework for obtaining National Bank of Moldova authorization.\n\n**Impact:** Operating without proper authorization could result in regulatory enforcement actions, fines, license revocation, and criminal liability for company executives.\n\n**Recommendation:** Immediately establish a licensing compliance framework. Engage legal counsel to determine specific authorization requirements from the National Bank of Moldova. Develop a policy for obtaining and maintaining necessary licenses before any stablecoin operations commence.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Reserve requirements and asset backing for stablecoins\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found\n\n**Gap:** No policies governing reserve management, asset composition, custody arrangements, or audit requirements for stablecoin backing assets.\n\n**Impact:** Failure to maintain adequate reserves could lead to stablecoin depegging, loss of consumer confidence, regulatory sanctions, and potential insolvency.\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive reserve management policy including: 1) Minimum reserve requirements (likely 100% backing), 2) Permissible asset types (likely high-quality liquid assets), 3) Segregated custody arrangements, 4) Regular independent audits, 5) Public disclosure requirements.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance for stablecoin transactions\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found\n\n**Gap:** No anti-money laundering or counter-terrorist financing policies specific to stablecoin operations, including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, or suspicious activity reporting.\n\n**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties, loss of banking relationships, reputational damage, and potential criminal liability for facilitating illicit financial flows.\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive AML/CFT program including: 1) Customer identification and verification (KYC), 2) Transaction monitoring systems, 3) Suspicious activity reporting procedures, 4) Record-keeping requirements, 5) Designated compliance officer appointment.\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop consumer protection framework including: 1) Clear terms of service, 2) Risk disclosure statements, 3) Redemption rights and procedures, 4) Complaint resolution process, 5) Data protection and privacy safeguards.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish comprehensive operational risk management program including: 1) Cybersecurity controls and testing, 2) Incident response plan, 3) Business continuity and disaster recovery, 4) Third-party risk management, 5) Regular security audits.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-006\n**Requirement:** Reporting and transparency obligations\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop reporting and transparency framework including: 1) Regulatory reporting calendar and procedures, 2) Public reserve attestations, 3) Transaction record-keeping, 4) Regulatory examination preparedness, 5) Whistleblower procedures.\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **licensing_authorization**: not_met\n❌ **reserve_requirements**: not_met\n❌ **aml_cft_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **consumer_protection**: not_met\n❌ **operational_risk**: not_met\n❌ **reporting_transparency**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update Summary\nGenerated: 2026-02-06T03:32:50.554030\n\n## Overview\nThis document summarizes proposed updates to company policies and standards based on regulatory gap analysis.\n\n## New Policies Required\n\n## Modified Policies\n\n### GAP-001\n**Category:** Legal\n**Current Policy:** No documented policy found\n**Proposed Change:** Immediately establish a licensing compliance framework.
