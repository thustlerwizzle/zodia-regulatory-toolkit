There is a complete absence of documented policies addressing core regulatory pillars: licensing, reserve backing, AML/CFT, consumer protection, cybersecurity, and governance. Operating in this state exposes the company to extreme legal, financial, and reputational risks, including immediate regulatory shutdown, severe penalties, and loss of user funds. Urgent and comprehensive policy development is required before any further operational steps are taken. The priority must be to establish a foundational compliance framework, beginning with engaging the national regulator (AMBD) and implementing critical policies for reserves and AML."

Assets must be held in segregated, bankruptcy-remote arrangements with reputable custodians.\n*   **Transparency & Disclosure:** Publish monthly reports on the composition and value of Backing Assets, attested to by an independent auditor. Provide clear, non-misleading disclosures to users regarding risks, fees, and redemption rights.\n*   **Operational Resilience:** Implement robust IT systems, cybersecurity protocols, and business continuity plans.\n*   **Risk Management:** Maintain a dedicated risk management function that regularly identifies, assesses, and mitigates all material risks.\n*   **Consumer Protection:** Establish fair terms of service, ensure timely redemption at par value, and maintain an effective complaint resolution mechanism.\n*   **AML/CFT Compliance:** Conduct customer due diligence (CDD), monitor transactions, report suspicious activities, and comply with all relevant financial sanctions.\n*   **Reporting:** Submit periodic regulatory returns (frequency to be determined with AMBD) and immediately report any Significant Incident.\n*   **Audit & Assurance:** Undergo annual audits by an independent, qualified auditor approved by the regulator.\n\n## 7.

All specific requirements, thresholds, and reporting formats are subject to finalization through direct engagement with AMBD.*"

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Brunei\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-01-30T19:36:29.624565\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company's current policies represent a state of near-total non-compliance with the fundamental regulatory expectations for operating a stablecoin, both in Brunei (based on its adherence to international standards) and globally. There is a complete absence of documented policies addressing core regulatory pillars: licensing, reserve backing, AML/CFT, consumer protection, cybersecurity, and governance. Operating in this state exposes the company to extreme legal, financial, and reputational risks, including immediate regulatory shutdown, severe penalties, and loss of user funds. Urgent and comprehensive policy development is required before any further operational steps are taken. The priority must be to establish a foundational compliance framework, beginning with engaging the national regulator (AMBD) and implementing critical policies for reserves and AML.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Authorization/Licensing for stablecoin issuance and services (based on international standards and regional trends)\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing licensing requirements for stablecoin operations in Brunei. No framework for obtaining necessary approvals from Autoriti Monetari Brunei Darussalam (AMBD).\n\n**Impact:** Potential for operating illegally, regulatory enforcement actions, fines, business shutdown, and reputational damage.\n\n**Recommendation:** Immediately establish a licensing framework policy. Engage with AMBD to understand specific requirements. Document application procedures, ongoing compliance obligations, and reporting requirements.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Reserve Management and Full Backing (common requirement for stablecoins globally)\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found\n\n**Gap:** No policies governing the custody, composition, audit, or segregation of reserve assets backing the stablecoin.\n\n**Impact:** Risk of insolvency, loss of peg, consumer harm, loss of trust, and regulatory intervention for operating a potentially fraudulent scheme.\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop a comprehensive Reserve Management Policy. This should mandate 1:1 backing with high-quality liquid assets, define eligible assets, require regular (at least monthly) attestations by independent auditors, and ensure clear segregation of customer funds.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering/Counter-Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) compliance (required under Brunei's AMLCFT Order, 2010 and FATF standards)\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found\n\n**Gap:** No AML/CFT program tailored to virtual asset services, including stablecoin transactions. Missing Customer Due Diligence (CDD), transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting (SAR), and record-keeping procedures.\n\n**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, criminal liability for the company and directors, loss of banking relationships, and inclusion on international watchlists.\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement a robust, risk-based AML/CFT Policy specific to digital assets. Include KYC/CDD procedures for all users, transaction monitoring for unusual patterns, a process for filing SARs with AMBD's Financial Intelligence Unit, and mandatory staff training.\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer Protection and Disclosure (implied by financial regulations and consumer protection laws)\n\n**Recommendation:** Create a Consumer Protection and Disclosure Policy. Mandate clear public disclosure of the stablecoin's mechanics, risks, fee structure, and redemption process. Develop comprehensive, legally-reviewed Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Cybersecurity and Operational Resilience (expected by financial regulators globally)\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish an Information Security and Operational Resilience Policy. Implement industry-standard security frameworks (e.g., ISO 27001), conduct regular penetration testing, enforce cold/hot wallet management protocols, and develop a detailed incident response and disaster recovery plan.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-006\n**Requirement:** Governance and Risk Management Framework (core principle of financial regulation)\n\n**Recommendation:** Formalize a Corporate Governance and Risk Management Policy. Define board-level oversight of compliance, appoint a Chief Compliance Officer, and implement a three-lines-of-defense model. Conduct regular risk assessments covering market, liquidity, credit, and operational risks.\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **Licensing and Authorization**: not_met\n❌ **Reserve Management and Backing**: not_met\n❌ **AML/CFT Compliance**: not_met\n❌ **Consumer Protection**: not_met\n❌ **Cybersecurity**: not_met\n❌ **Governance and Risk Management**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update Summary\nGenerated: 2026-01-30T19:37:09.955150\n\n## Overview\nThis document summarizes proposed updates to company policies and standards based on regulatory gap analysis.\n\n## New Policies Required\n\n## Modified Policies\n\n### GAP-001\n**Category:** Compliance\n**Current Policy:** No documented policy found\n**Proposed Change:** Immediately establish a licensing framework policy.
