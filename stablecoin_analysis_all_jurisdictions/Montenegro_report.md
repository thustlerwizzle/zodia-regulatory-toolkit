# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-06T03:51:51.955596

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no documented policies addressing stablecoin regulation in Montenegro, representing a complete regulatory vacuum. All fundamental regulatory requirements are unmet, creating extreme legal, operational, and reputational risks. Immediate action is required to: 1) Conduct comprehensive regulatory research on Montenegro's digital asset framework, 2) Develop interim policies based on international standards (EU MiCA, FATF recommendations), and 3) Engage local legal counsel to navigate Montenegro's regulatory landscape. The company should not engage in any stablecoin-related activities until basic compliance frameworks are established and approved by legal counsel.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Legal framework for stablecoin issuance and operation in Montenegro

**Current Status:** No documented policies found

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing stablecoin operations, despite Montenegro's growing interest in digital assets and potential regulatory developments

**Impact:** Legal exposure, regulatory sanctions, inability to operate legally, potential criminal liability for directors

**Recommendation:** Immediately establish a regulatory monitoring system for Montenegro's financial regulations. Develop interim policies based on EU MiCA framework as a benchmark until local regulations are clarified.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance for digital assets

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CTF policies for digital assets

**Gap:** Lack of specific AML/CTF procedures for stablecoin transactions, customer due diligence for crypto-related activities, and suspicious transaction monitoring for digital assets

**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, loss of banking relationships, reputational damage, potential criminal prosecution

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive AML/CTF policy for digital assets incorporating FATF Travel Rule requirements, enhanced due diligence for crypto transactions, and specific monitoring rules for stablecoin transfers.

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Licensing and registration requirements

**Current Status:** No licensing strategy or compliance tracking

**Gap:** No documented approach to obtaining necessary licenses, no regulatory relationship management, no compliance monitoring system

**Impact:** Operating without required licenses, immediate regulatory action, fines, and business cessation

**Recommendation:** Conduct regulatory landscape assessment for Montenegro, engage local legal counsel, develop licensing roadmap, and establish regulatory relationship management procedures.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements

**Recommendation:** Create consumer protection framework including clear risk disclosures, terms of service, complaint resolution procedures, and information on redemption rights for stablecoins.

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Capital and reserve requirements for stablecoin issuers

**Recommendation:** Establish reserve management policy requiring 1:1 backing with high-quality liquid assets, regular attestations/audits, and clear redemption procedures.

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive operational risk framework including multi-signature wallet policies, key management procedures, smart contract security protocols, and incident response plans for digital asset incidents.
