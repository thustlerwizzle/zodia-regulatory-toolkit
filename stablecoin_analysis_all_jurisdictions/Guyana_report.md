# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-31T00:02:12.661511

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no documented policies addressing any of the core regulatory requirements for stablecoin operations in Guyana. Based on international standards and emerging regulatory trends, all fundamental compliance areas are completely unaddressed. The company is operating in a pre-compliance state and would face immediate regulatory action if offering services. Urgent action is required across all compliance domains, with immediate priority on licensing engagement, reserve management, and AML/CFT frameworks. The company should not commence operations until these critical gaps are addressed.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must maintain 1:1 reserves in high-quality liquid assets (based on international standards like BIS/FSB recommendations)

**Current Status:** No documented reserve management policy

**Gap:** Complete absence of reserve management framework, including asset composition, custody, and audit requirements

**Impact:** Regulatory enforcement action, loss of license, reputational damage, potential consumer harm if reserves are insufficient

**Recommendation:** Develop and implement a comprehensive reserve management policy specifying: 1) Eligible asset types (cash, government securities), 2) Segregated custody arrangements, 3) Monthly independent attestations, 4) Public disclosure of reserve composition

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting (aligned with FATF recommendations)

**Current Status:** No AML/CFT program documented

**Gap:** Missing entire AML/CFT framework required for virtual asset service providers

**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, criminal liability, loss of banking relationships, exclusion from financial system

**Recommendation:** Establish a full AML/CFT program including: 1) Risk-based customer identification and verification, 2) Ongoing transaction monitoring system, 3) Designated compliance officer, 4) Regular staff training, 5) SAR filing procedures

### Gap 3: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Licensing/registration with relevant authorities (Bank of Guyana or proposed regulatory body)

**Current Status:** No licensing strategy or application process documented

**Gap:** No evidence of engagement with regulators or understanding of licensing requirements

**Impact:** Operating illegally, immediate shutdown orders, fines, director liability

**Recommendation:** Immediately initiate regulatory engagement to determine licensing requirements and submit necessary applications before offering services

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including clear disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling

**Recommendation:** Create consumer protection framework with: 1) Clear terms of service and risk disclosures, 2) Guaranteed redemption procedures, 3) Dedicated complaint handling process, 4) Escrow mechanisms for disputed transactions

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity standards

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive cybersecurity program including: 1) Multi-sig wallet management, 2) Cold storage protocols, 3) Incident response plan, 4) Regular penetration testing, 5) Business continuity planning

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Regular reporting to regulators (financial, operational, compliance)

**Recommendation:** Develop regulatory reporting calendar and templates for: 1) Monthly reserve attestations, 2) Quarterly financial statements, 3) Annual compliance reports, 4) Incident reporting protocols
