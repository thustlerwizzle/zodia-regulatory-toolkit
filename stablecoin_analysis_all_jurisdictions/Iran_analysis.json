Purpose and Scope  \n**Purpose:**  \nThis policy establishes a comprehensive framework to ensure the organization’s full compliance with all applicable international, national, and regional sanctions imposed against Iran. It is designed to prevent violations, manage associated risks, and provide clear guidance for decision-making when engaging—or ceasing to engage—in any activity involving Iran, Iranian persons, or the Iranian financial system.\n\n**Scope:**  \nThis policy applies globally to all directors, officers, employees, contractors, agents, and subsidiaries of the organization (collectively, \"Personnel\"). It governs all business operations, transactions, trade, financial dealings, and partnerships that have a direct or indirect nexus to Iran, including but not limited to:\n*   Direct sales, purchases, or investments.\n*   Indirect dealings through intermediaries, distributors, or third parties.\n*   Financial transactions and services.\n*   Technology transfers and provision of services.\n*   Any activity that could be deemed as facilitating a prohibited transaction.\n\n## 3. Definitions  \n*   **Sanctions Lists:** Official lists of designated individuals, entities, vessels, and sectors issued by regulatory bodies (e.g., OFAC SDN List, EU Consolidated List, UN Security Council List).\n*   **Iranian Person:** Any individual who is a citizen or resident of Iran; any entity organized under the laws of Iran or having a principal place of business in Iran; and any person owned or controlled by the foregoing.\n*   **Dual Compliance Assessment:** The process of evaluating obligations under conflicting sanctions regimes (e.g., U.S. vs. EU) to determine the highest standard of compliance required for the organization.\n*   **Conflict Resolution Framework:** A structured process for resolving disagreements between business units and the Compliance Department regarding sanctions risk interpretations.\n*   **Exit Strategy:** A pre-defined and approved plan for the lawful and orderly termination of an existing business relationship or activity involving Iran.\n*   **Compliance Officer (Iran Sanctions):** The designated individual with ultimate responsibility for the implementation and oversight of this policy.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement  \nIt is the strict policy of this organization to comply with all applicable sanctions laws and regulations concerning Iran. We expressly prohibit any unauthorized transaction or dealing, direct or indirect, with:\n1.  The Government of Iran, its political subdivisions, agencies, and instrumentalities.\n2.  Any individual, entity, vessel, or sector on relevant Sanctions Lists.\n3.  Any activity that is otherwise prohibited under U.S., EU, UN, or other applicable sanctions programs (e.g., certain sectors of the Iranian economy).\nThe Compliance Department has absolute authority to veto any proposed activity involving Iran. When in doubt, Personnel must presume an activity is prohibited until cleared in writing by the Compliance Officer.\n\n## 5. Procedures  \n\n### 5.1. Pre-Engagement Due Diligence\nPrior to initiating any potential business activity with a nexus to Iran, the requesting business unit must:\n*   Submit a **Sanctions Risk Assessment Form** to the Compliance Department.\n*   Conduct thorough screening of all potential counterparties, intermediaries, and beneficial owners against current Sanctions Lists.\n*   Identify the specific sanctions regimes applicable to the proposed activity.\n\n### 5.2. Dual Compliance Assessment\nFor any activity not explicitly prohibited, the Compliance Department will conduct a Dual Compliance Assessment:\n*   Identify all applicable sanctions regimes (e.g., if a non-U.S. subsidiary deals with a non-sanctioned Iranian entity, both local and U.S. regulations may apply).\n*   Apply the most restrictive requirements to ensure global compliance and mitigate extraterritorial risk.\n*   Document the assessment and the rationale for the final compliance decision.\n\n### 5.3. Conflict Resolution Framework\nIf a business unit disagrees with the Compliance Department's risk assessment or prohibition:\n1.  **Stage 1:** Formal review meeting between business unit head and Compliance Officer.\n2.  **Stage 2:** Escalation to a **Sanctions Compliance Committee** (SCC) comprised of senior legal, compliance, and finance executives.\n3.  **Stage 3:** Final decision by the Chief Executive Officer, based on the SCC's recommendation. **No activity may proceed during the conflict resolution process.**\n\n### 5.4. Escalation Procedures\nPersonnel must immediately escalate to the Compliance Officer:\n*   Any suspected or actual violation of sanctions.\n*   Any request to circumvent sanctions controls.\n*   Any \"red flag\" indicator (e.g., a counterparty uses multiple banks to process payments, requests unusual secrecy).\n*   Any receipt of a blocking or reject notification from a financial institution related to Iran.\nThe Compliance Officer will initiate an investigation, implement interim controls, and determine mandatory reporting to relevant authorities.\n\n### 5.5. Exit Strategy Planning\nFor any pre-existing or newly permitted activity involving Iran, the responsible business unit must, in consultation with Compliance, develop a written **Exit Strategy Plan** that includes:\n*   Clear contractual triggers for termination (e.g., change in sanctions law, designation of a counterparty).\n*   Wind-down procedures compliant with applicable licenses or general authorizations.\n*   Plans for settling outstanding financial obligations lawfully.\n*   Communication protocols with the counterparty.\nThis plan must be approved prior to the commencement of the activity and reviewed semi-annually.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements  \n*   **Training:** All relevant Personnel must complete mandatory Iran-specific sanctions training annually.\n*   **Recordkeeping:** All due diligence, assessments, approvals, and escalation records must be maintained for a minimum of five years.\n*   **Reporting:** Suspected violations must be reported internally immediately; external reporting to regulators will be determined by the Compliance Officer and Legal Counsel.\n*   **Certification:** Business unit leaders must certify quarterly that they are unaware of any violations of this policy within their units.\n*   **Audit:** Internal Audit will conduct periodic reviews of Iran-related controls and transactions.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule  \nThis policy shall be reviewed and updated:\n*   **Annually,** as part of the standard compliance policy review cycle.\n*   **Ad-hoc,** within 30 days of any material change to the Iran-related sanctions landscape.\n*   All updates require approval by the Sanctions Compliance Committee.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements  \nThis policy is designed to ensure compliance with, but is not limited to, the following regulatory frameworks:\n*   **United States:** Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations (ITSR), Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act (CISADA), Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act (IFCA).\n*   **European Union:** EU Council Regulations concerning restrictive measures against Iran.\n*   **United Nations:** UN Security Council Resolutions pertaining to Iran.\n*   **Other Jurisdictions:** Applicable national sanctions laws in all countries where the organization operates (e.g., UK, Canada, Australia, Singapore).\n*   **Industry Standards:** Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Recommendations.\n```"

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Iran\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-01-31T00:40:26.559920\n\n## Executive Summary\nCRITICAL COMPLIANCE FAILURE: The company has no policies addressing Iranian stablecoin regulations, representing a complete regulatory gap. All regulatory requirements are unmet. Immediate action is required to suspend operations and develop comprehensive policies before considering any activity in Iran. The situation is particularly complex due to conflicts between Iranian regulations and international sanctions regimes. Priority should be given to legal risk assessment and policy development before any operational decisions.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Iran has comprehensive cryptocurrency regulations under the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) and the Ministry of Information and Communications Technology (ICT). Stablecoins are treated as cryptocurrencies and subject to licensing, AML/CFT requirements, and operational restrictions.\n\n**Current Status:** No company policies found for stablecoin operations in Iran\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing Iranian regulatory requirements for stablecoin issuance, trading, or custody\n\n**Impact:** Severe legal and financial risks including criminal penalties, asset seizure, business shutdown, and executive liability\n\n**Recommendation:** Immediately suspend all stablecoin operations in Iran until comprehensive policies are developed and approved. Engage Iranian legal counsel to interpret local regulations and draft compliant policies.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Mandatory licensing from Central Bank of Iran for cryptocurrency operations including stablecoins\n\n**Current Status:** No licensing policy or procedure\n\n**Gap:** No policy addressing licensing requirements, application processes, or ongoing license maintenance\n\n**Impact:** Operating without required license constitutes illegal activity with severe penalties\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop licensing policy including: 1) License requirement assessment, 2) Application procedures, 3) Compliance monitoring, 4) Renewal processes\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and reporting to Iranian Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU)\n\n**Current Status:** No Iran-specific AML/CFT policies\n\n**Gap:** Lack of policies addressing Iran's specific AML/CFT requirements which differ from international standards\n\n**Impact:** Criminal liability for money laundering violations, substantial fines, and reputational damage\n\n**Recommendation:** Create Iran-specific AML/CFT policy aligned with CBI requirements, including: 1) Enhanced KYC for Iranian customers, 2) Local transaction monitoring, 3) FIU reporting procedures\n\n### Gap 4: GAP-006\n**Requirement:** Sanctions compliance given Iran's international sanctions status\n\n**Current Status:** No Iran-specific sanctions compliance policy\n\n**Gap:** Lack of policies addressing dual compliance with Iranian regulations and international sanctions regimes\n\n**Impact:** Simultaneous violation of Iranian law and international sanctions with severe multi-jurisdictional penalties\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive sanctions compliance policy including: 1) Conflict resolution framework, 2) Dual compliance assessment, 3) Escalation procedures, 4) Exit strategy planning\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Data localization and privacy requirements under Iranian law\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop data governance policy for Iran including: 1) Data localization requirements, 2) Privacy protections, 3) Government access protocols, 4) Cross-border data transfer restrictions\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Operational requirements including capital adequacy, reserve requirements for stablecoin issuers, and technical standards\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish operational policy framework covering: 1) Capital requirements, 2) Reserve management and auditing, 3) Technical compliance standards, 4) Risk management protocols\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **iran_licensing_requirements**: not_met\n❌ **iran_aml_cft_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **iran_data_localization**: not_met\n❌ **iran_operational_requirements**: not_met\n❌ **sanctions_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **overall_regulatory_framework**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update Summary\nGenerated: 2026-01-31T00:40:54.331414\n\n## Overview\nThis document summarizes proposed updates to company policies and standards based on regulatory gap analysis.\n\n## New Policies Required\n\n## Modified Policies\n\n### GAP-001\n**Category:** AML/KYC\n**Current Policy:** No company policies found for stablecoin operations in Iran\n**Proposed Change:** Immediately suspend all stablecoin operations in Iran until comprehensive policies are developed and approved.
