# Gap Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits complete non-compliance with Czech stablecoin regulatory requirements. No policies exist to address fundamental regulatory obligations including authorization, AML/CFT, consumer protection, reserve management, operational risk, or data protection. This represents an extreme compliance risk requiring immediate executive attention and resource allocation. The company must develop a comprehensive regulatory compliance program from the ground up, prioritizing authorization requirements and AML/CFT compliance before any stablecoin operations can commence. Given the evolving regulatory landscape with MiCA implementation approaching, the company should adopt a forward-looking approach that anticipates both current Czech requirements and forthcoming EU standards.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance requires authorization from Czech National Bank (CNB) under Act No. 277/2013 Coll. on Payment Systems and Act No. 21/1992 Coll. on Banks, with additional oversight under EU's MiCA framework (applicable from 2024).

**Current Status:** No documented policy for stablecoin issuance or regulatory authorization process.

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing regulatory authorization requirements for issuing or operating stablecoins in Czech Republic.

**Impact:** Potential regulatory enforcement actions, fines, license revocation, and criminal liability for unauthorized financial activities.

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive authorization policy outlining CNB application process, capital requirements, governance standards, and MiCA compliance roadmap.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance under Czech AML Act (Act No. 253/2008 Coll.) requiring customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and reporting to Financial Analytical Unit.

**Current Status:** No AML/CFT policy documented for cryptocurrency or stablecoin operations.

**Gap:** Missing AML/CFT framework specifically addressing stablecoin transactions, customer verification, and suspicious activity reporting.

**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties, loss of banking relationships, reputational damage, and potential criminal prosecution.

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive AML/CFT program including risk assessment, KYC procedures, transaction monitoring, and FATF Travel Rule compliance for stablecoins.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Consumer protection requirements including clear disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling under Czech Consumer Protection Act (Act No. 634/1992 Coll.) and EU consumer law.

**Recommendation:** Develop consumer protection framework including clear terms of service, redemption policy, complaint handling procedures, and risk disclosures.

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Reserve management and transparency requirements for asset-backed stablecoins under emerging EU standards and CNB expectations.

**Recommendation:** Establish reserve management policy detailing eligible assets, custody solutions, regular audits, and public reporting of reserve composition.

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational risk management including cybersecurity, business continuity, and IT governance under CNB's expectations for payment service providers.

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive operational risk framework aligned with ISO 27001, including cybersecurity protocols, incident response plans, and business continuity testing.
