# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-07T10:28:56.761907

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits a complete absence of regulatory compliance infrastructure for stablecoin operations in the Falkland Islands jurisdiction. All fundamental regulatory requirements are unmet, representing critical regulatory risk. Immediate action is required to establish basic compliance frameworks before commencing operations. The most critical gaps requiring immediate attention are licensing authorization, reserve management, and AML/CTF compliance. Without addressing these foundational requirements, the company faces severe regulatory consequences including enforcement actions, fines, and potential criminal liability. A phased implementation approach is recommended, starting with regulatory engagement and licensing, followed by core compliance program development.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must maintain 1:1 reserves in high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) for all issued tokens

**Current Status:** No documented reserve management policy exists

**Gap:** Complete absence of reserve management framework, custody arrangements, or asset verification procedures

**Impact:** Regulatory enforcement action, license revocation, reputational damage, and potential insolvency if reserves are insufficient

**Recommendation:** Develop and implement a comprehensive reserve management policy specifying: 1) Eligible asset classes (cash, government securities, etc.), 2) Custody arrangements with regulated custodians, 3) Monthly independent attestations/audits, 4) Public disclosure of reserve composition

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must obtain authorization/license from the Falkland Islands Financial Services Commission (FIFSC) or equivalent regulator

**Current Status:** No licensing or authorization policy exists

**Gap:** No documented process for regulatory engagement, licensing applications, or ongoing regulatory reporting

**Impact:** Operating illegally, immediate cease-and-desist orders, fines, and criminal liability for directors

**Recommendation:** 1) Conduct regulatory mapping to identify exact licensing requirements, 2) Establish regulatory engagement protocol, 3) Create licensing application project plan with timelines and responsibilities, 4) Designate compliance officer with regulatory liaison responsibility

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance including customer due diligence (CDD), transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting

**Current Status:** No AML/CTF program exists

**Gap:** Complete absence of KYC procedures, transaction monitoring systems, sanctions screening, or suspicious activity reporting mechanisms

**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, loss of banking relationships, potential criminal prosecution for money laundering offenses

**Recommendation:** Implement a risk-based AML/CTF program including: 1) Customer identification and verification procedures, 2) Ongoing transaction monitoring system, 3) Sanctions screening against OFAC, UN, and EU lists, 4) Designated Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO), 5) Regular staff training

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including clear disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling procedures

**Recommendation:** Develop consumer protection framework including: 1) Clear, plain-language terms of service, 2) Guaranteed redemption rights with defined timelines, 3) Transparent fee schedule, 4) Formal complaint handling procedure with escalation paths, 5) Public-facing disclosures about risks and protections

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity requirements for payment systems and financial institutions

**Recommendation:** Establish operational resilience framework: 1) Business impact analysis, 2) Incident response plan, 3) Cybersecurity controls aligned with NIST or ISO 27001, 4) Third-party vendor risk management program, 5) Regular penetration testing and security audits

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Governance and risk management framework with board oversight and independent compliance function

**Recommendation:** Establish governance framework: 1) Board risk committee charter, 2) Three lines of defense model, 3) Independent compliance function with direct board reporting, 4) Comprehensive risk assessment process, 5) Regular board training on regulatory obligations
