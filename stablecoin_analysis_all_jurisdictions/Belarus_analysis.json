This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Belarus\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-01-30T18:45:21.826869\n\n## Executive Summary\nCRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no documented policies addressing Belarusian stablecoin regulations. Based on available information and general regulatory knowledge, all core regulatory requirements appear unmet. The company is operating in a high-risk compliance vacuum with potential for severe legal, financial, and reputational consequences. Immediate action is required to: 1) Suspend Belarus operations until regulatory clarity is obtained, 2) Conduct comprehensive regulatory research with local counsel, 3) Develop and implement a complete compliance framework before resuming operations. The absence of any documented policies suggests either complete lack of regulatory awareness or failure to document compliance efforts, both representing critical governance failures.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Legal authorization and licensing for stablecoin issuance and operations in Belarus\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing Belarusian regulatory requirements for stablecoin operations, including licensing, registration, and authorization procedures\n\n**Impact:** Legal prohibition of operations, potential criminal liability, fines, and complete business shutdown in Belarus\n\n**Recommendation:** Immediately suspend Belarus operations until comprehensive regulatory analysis is completed.
