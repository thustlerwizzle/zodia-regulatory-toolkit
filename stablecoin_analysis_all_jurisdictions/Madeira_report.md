# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-12T17:30:18.455378

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits complete non-compliance with stablecoin regulatory requirements in Madeira. No policies exist to address fundamental regulatory obligations including licensing, reserve management, consumer protection, AML/CFT, operational resilience, or governance. This represents an extreme compliance risk that requires immediate and comprehensive remediation. The company must prioritize establishing a complete policy framework before engaging in any stablecoin-related activities in Madeira. Given the absence of specific Madeira regulations in the research results, the analysis assumes application of EU-level frameworks (particularly MiCA) and Portuguese financial regulations that would likely govern stablecoin activities in the autonomous region.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance requires authorization/licensing from Madeira financial regulator (Assumed requirement based on EU/Portuguese financial services framework)

**Current Status:** No documented policy for stablecoin issuance authorization

**Gap:** Complete absence of policy addressing licensing requirements for stablecoin issuance in Madeira jurisdiction

**Impact:** Potential regulatory enforcement actions, fines, or prohibition of operations in Madeira

**Recommendation:** Develop and implement a Stablecoin Issuance Authorization Policy that outlines licensing requirements, application procedures, and ongoing compliance obligations

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Reserve requirements for stablecoin issuers (assumed based on EU MiCA framework)

**Current Status:** No documented reserve management or custody policies

**Gap:** Missing policies governing reserve composition, custody arrangements, and regular auditing of reserve assets

**Impact:** Risk of insufficient backing for stablecoins, loss of consumer confidence, and regulatory sanctions

**Recommendation:** Create Reserve Management Policy specifying eligible reserve assets, custody requirements, segregation rules, and audit frequency

### Gap 3: GAP-004
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance for stablecoin transactions

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT policies specific to stablecoin operations

**Gap:** Absence of policies addressing transaction monitoring, customer due diligence, and suspicious activity reporting for stablecoin activities

**Impact:** Significant regulatory enforcement risk, potential criminal liability, and loss of banking relationships

**Recommendation:** Develop Stablecoin AML/CFT Policy incorporating transaction monitoring, KYC procedures, and SAR reporting requirements

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements for stablecoin holders

**Recommendation:** Implement Consumer Protection Policy covering redemption procedures, fee schedules, risk disclosures, and complaint resolution mechanisms

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity requirements

**Recommendation:** Establish Operational Resilience Policy covering system redundancy, incident response plans, and cybersecurity controls for stablecoin platforms
