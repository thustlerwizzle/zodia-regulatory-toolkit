# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T05:41:02.685651

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no documented policies addressing Argentine stablecoin regulations. All regulatory requirements are completely unmet, creating severe legal, operational, and reputational risks. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive compliance framework. The most critical gaps requiring immediate attention are registration/licensing and AML/CFT compliance, as operating without these could result in immediate regulatory shutdown and criminal liability. A phased implementation approach is recommended, starting with foundational policies (registration, AML/CFT) before addressing operational and consumer protection requirements.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Registration/Licensing: Argentina's BCRA (Central Bank) requires entities issuing or operating with stablecoins to obtain proper authorization and registration.

**Current Status:** No documented policy for regulatory registration or licensing requirements

**Gap:** Complete absence of policy addressing mandatory registration with BCRA for stablecoin operations

**Impact:** Legal prohibition of operations, severe penalties, potential criminal liability, and business shutdown

**Recommendation:** Immediately develop and implement a regulatory registration policy that includes: 1) BCRA registration process, 2) ongoing compliance monitoring, 3) record-keeping requirements, 4) designated compliance officer responsibilities

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** AML/CFT Compliance: Argentina's UIF (Financial Information Unit) requires comprehensive anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing programs for stablecoin operations.

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT policies or procedures

**Gap:** Missing entire AML/CFT framework including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and record retention

**Impact:** Significant regulatory fines, criminal prosecution, loss of banking relationships, and reputational damage

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive AML/CFT program including: 1) Customer Identification Program (CIP), 2) Enhanced Due Diligence for high-risk customers, 3) Transaction monitoring system, 4) Suspicious Activity Reporting procedures, 5) Employee training program

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Reserve Requirements: Stablecoin issuers must maintain adequate reserves in Argentine pesos or approved foreign currency, with regular auditing and reporting.

**Recommendation:** Create reserve management policy covering: 1) Minimum reserve requirements, 2) Custody arrangements, 3) Quarterly independent audits, 4) Regulatory reporting templates, 5) Reserve transparency disclosures

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer Protection: Requirements for clear disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling mechanisms for stablecoin users.

**Recommendation:** Implement consumer protection framework including: 1) Clear terms of service, 2) Redemption policy, 3) Complaint handling procedures, 4) Risk disclosure statements, 5) User education materials

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Data Protection: Compliance with Argentina's Personal Data Protection Law (Law 25.326) for user data handling.

**Recommendation:** Create comprehensive data protection policy aligned with Law 25.326 including: 1) Data processing principles, 2) User consent mechanisms, 3) Data security measures, 4) Data breach response plan, 5) User rights procedures

### Gap 4: GAP-007
**Requirement:** Operational Risk Management: BCRA expectations for robust operational risk frameworks including cybersecurity and business continuity.

**Recommendation:** Establish operational risk management framework including: 1) Cybersecurity policy, 2) Business continuity plan, 3) Disaster recovery procedures, 4) Regular risk assessments, 5) Incident response plan
