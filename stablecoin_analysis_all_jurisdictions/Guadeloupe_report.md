# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-12T16:39:08.162237

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no documented policies addressing stablecoin regulation in Guadeloupe (French jurisdiction). All regulatory requirements are unmet, creating severe legal and operational risks. Immediate action is required to: 1) Suspend any current operations until authorization is obtained, 2) Develop comprehensive compliance framework addressing French/EU regulatory requirements, 3) Engage with French regulators (ACPR) for authorization process. The absence of basic policies indicates fundamental lack of compliance infrastructure for operating as a regulated financial service provider in this jurisdiction.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance and operation requires authorization from French financial authorities (ACPR/Banque de France) as Guadeloupe is an overseas department of France, subject to EU regulations including MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation)

**Current Status:** No documented policy for stablecoin operations in Guadeloupe/French jurisdiction

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing authorization requirements, capital requirements, governance, and operational standards for stablecoin issuance in French territories

**Impact:** Legal prohibition of operations, severe regulatory penalties, potential criminal liability for unauthorized financial services, reputational damage

**Recommendation:** Immediately suspend any stablecoin operations in Guadeloupe until proper authorization is obtained. Develop comprehensive authorization strategy including engagement with ACPR, application preparation, and interim compliance measures.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Compliance with EU's MiCA regulation for asset-referenced tokens (ARTs) and e-money tokens (EMTs), including reserve requirements, redemption rights, and disclosure obligations

**Current Status:** No MiCA-specific policies documented

**Gap:** Missing policies for reserve management, redemption mechanisms, white paper requirements, and ongoing disclosure obligations under MiCA framework

**Impact:** Non-compliance with EU-wide regulation, enforcement actions from multiple EU authorities, inability to operate legally in EU/EEA markets

**Recommendation:** Develop MiCA compliance framework including: 1) Reserve management policy with segregation requirements, 2) Redemption policy with clear procedures and timelines, 3) Disclosure policy for white papers and periodic reporting, 4) Governance structure for compliance oversight.

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance under French anti-money laundering regulations (implementing EU AMLD5/6) including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and reporting obligations

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT policies for Guadeloupe operations

**Gap:** Lack of jurisdiction-specific AML/CFT procedures, risk assessment, customer identification, and suspicious activity reporting mechanisms

**Impact:** Significant regulatory fines, criminal prosecution for money laundering offenses, loss of banking relationships, business closure

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive AML/CFT program including: 1) Risk-based approach documentation, 2) Customer due diligence procedures, 3) Transaction monitoring system, 4) Suspicious activity reporting protocols, 5) Employee training program.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection requirements including clear terms of service, dispute resolution mechanisms, and transparency about risks

**Recommendation:** Develop consumer protection framework including: 1) Clear terms of service and risk disclosures, 2) Complaint handling procedures, 3) Dispute resolution mechanism, 4) Marketing and communication guidelines.

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity requirements for financial institutions operating in French jurisdiction

**Recommendation:** Establish operational resilience framework including: 1) Cybersecurity policy aligned with French financial sector requirements, 2) Business continuity and disaster recovery plans, 3) Incident response procedures, 4) Regular security testing and audits.

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Governance and internal control requirements including board oversight, risk management, and compliance function

**Recommendation:** Implement governance framework including: 1) Board charter with compliance oversight responsibilities, 2) Three lines of defense model, 3) Independent compliance function, 4) Risk management policy, 5) Internal audit program.
