Policy Title\nAsset-Backed Stablecoin Reserve Management, Auditing, and Public Disclosure Policy\n\n## 2. Purpose and Scope\n### 2.1 Purpose\nThe purpose of this policy is to establish a rigorous framework for the management, custody, and independent verification of reserve assets backing all issued stablecoins. This policy ensures operational integrity, promotes transparency, and maintains stakeholder confidence by guaranteeing that stablecoins are fully backed at all times by high-quality, segregated reserve assets.\n\n### 2.2 Scope\nThis policy applies to all stablecoin issuance activities, reserve management operations, and related reporting functions within the organization. It governs the actions of all employees, contractors, and third-party service providers involved in the custody, management, or reporting of reserve assets.\n\n## 3.

This audit will provide an opinion on the financial statement presentation of the reserve and an assessment of internal controls over reserve management and reporting.\n\n### 5.3 Public Reporting\n*   A detailed report of reserve holdings, including asset types, percentages, and issuer/counterparty details, will be published on the organization’s official website within **15 business days** following the end of each calendar month.\n*   The results of the quarterly attestation reports will be published within **30 days** of receipt from the audit firm.\n*   The annual full-scope audit report will be published within **90 days** of the fiscal year-end.\n\n## 6.

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Guatemala\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-01-30T23:46:31.895289\n\n## Executive Summary\nOverall compliance status is severely deficient. The company lacks any documented policies to address the core regulatory requirements for operating a stablecoin or financial service in Guatemala. The current posture represents an extreme level of legal, financial, and reputational risk. Immediate and foundational work is required to establish a compliance program before any substantive business operations can be considered lawful or prudent. The highest priority must be given to engaging with the Superintendency of Banks (SIB) to understand the licensing perimeter and to building a foundational AML/CFT framework.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Authorization/Licensing for stablecoin issuance or service provision\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found\n\n**Gap:** Guatemala's financial regulatory framework, primarily governed by the Banking Law (Decree 19-2002) and supervised by the Superintendency of Banks (SIB), requires entities engaging in financial activities, which may include issuing payment instruments or managing payment systems, to obtain proper authorization. Stablecoin activities likely fall under this purview, but no company policy addresses licensing requirements.\n\n**Impact:** Operating without required authorization could result in severe penalties, including fines, cease-and-desist orders, criminal liability for directors, and reputational damage. The business model may be fundamentally illegal.\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Immediately engage with the Superintendency of Banks (SIB) to determine the specific licensing or registration pathway for the proposed stablecoin activity. 2. Develop a formal policy outlining the process for obtaining and maintaining all necessary financial licenses in Guatemala. 3. Halt any operational activity until regulatory status is clarified and approved.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (CFT) compliance\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found\n\n**Gap:** Guatemala's AML/CFT regime, aligned with FATF recommendations and enforced by the Intendencia de Verificación Especial (IVE), mandates that Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) implement a risk-based AML/CFT program. This includes Customer Due Diligence (CDD), transaction monitoring, reporting of suspicious transactions, and record-keeping. The company has no apparent policies to meet these obligations.\n\n**Impact:** Failure to comply with AML/CFT regulations leads to significant legal, financial, and reputational risks, including heavy fines, loss of licensing, and potential criminal prosecution. It also facilitates financial crime.\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Develop a comprehensive, risk-based AML/CFT policy compliant with Guatemalan law (e.g., as per the IVE). 2. Appoint a Compliance Officer. 3. Implement CDD/KYC procedures, transaction monitoring systems, and suspicious activity reporting protocols. 4. Establish employee training programs on AML/CFT requirements.\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Draft and implement a Consumer Protection Policy. 2. Create standardized, clear, and legally vetted disclosure documents for users. 3. Ensure all marketing materials are accurate and non-deceptive. 4. Establish formal procedures for handling customer complaints and disputes.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Reserve management and auditing for asset-backed stablecoins\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Develop a rigorous Reserve Management Policy detailing the custody (preferably with a licensed custodian), composition, and segregation of reserve assets. 2. Mandate quarterly attestations and annual full-scope audits by a reputable third-party audit firm. 3. Commit to public reporting of reserve holdings and audit results.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Cybersecurity and operational resilience\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Develop and implement a comprehensive Information Security Policy based on a framework like NIST or ISO 27001. 2. Create a formal Incident Response Plan and a Business Continuity/Disaster Recovery Plan. 3. Conduct regular penetration testing and security audits. 4. Obtain appropriate cybersecurity insurance.\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **Authorization_Licensing**: not_met\n❌ **AML_CFT_Compliance**: not_met\n❌ **Consumer_Protection**: not_met\n❌ **Reserve_Management_Audit**: not_met\n❌ **Cybersecurity_Resilience**: not_met\n❌ **Governance_Internal_Controls**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update Summary\nGenerated: 2026-01-30T23:47:28.022752\n\n## Overview\nThis document summarizes proposed updates to company policies and standards based on regulatory gap analysis.\n\n## New Policies Required\n\n## Modified Policies\n\n### GAP-001\n**Category:** Compliance\n**Current Policy:** No documented policy found\n**Proposed Change:** 1.
