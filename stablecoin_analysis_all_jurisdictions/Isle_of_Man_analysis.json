This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Isle of Man\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-02-11T20:48:33.933779\n\n## Executive Summary\nOverall compliance status is severely deficient. The company currently has no documented policies addressing the core regulatory requirements for issuing stablecoins in the Isle of Man. This represents a critical level of non-compliance, exposing the company to immediate and severe regulatory, legal, financial, and reputational risks. Operation in this state is not viable. An urgent, comprehensive policy development and implementation program is required, starting with securing regulatory authorization and establishing financial crime controls, before any commercial activity can commence.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must be authorized by the Isle of Man Financial Services Authority (IOMFSA) under the Financial Services Act 2008 or Designated Businesses (Registration and Oversight) Act 2015.\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy regarding regulatory authorization or licensing requirements.\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policy addressing the fundamental requirement to obtain proper authorization to issue stablecoins in the Isle of Man.\n\n**Impact:** Operating without authorization constitutes illegal activity, leading to enforcement actions, fines, license revocation, and reputational damage.\n\n**Recommendation:** Immediately establish a policy requiring formal application to IOMFSA for appropriate authorization before any stablecoin issuance. Policy should define the authorization process, responsible personnel, and documentation requirements.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Issuers must maintain adequate reserves (full backing) for issued stablecoins, with assets held in secure, segregated accounts. Regular independent audits of reserves are required.\n\n**Current Status:** No policy exists for reserve management, custody, or audit procedures.\n\n**Gap:** No framework to ensure stablecoins are fully backed by appropriate assets, posing significant risk of insolvency and loss of peg.\n\n**Impact:** Risk of consumer harm, loss of trust, regulatory sanctions for misrepresentation, and potential collapse of the stablecoin if redemptions cannot be met.\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop a comprehensive Reserve Management Policy detailing: 1) Acceptable reserve assets (e.g., cash, high-quality liquid assets), 2) Custody arrangements with regulated custodians, 3) Segregation of client funds, 4) Frequency and scope of independent audits, and 5) public reporting of reserve composition.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Robust Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF), and sanctions compliance programs are mandatory, including KYC/CDD, transaction monitoring, and reporting suspicious activity.\n\n**Current Status:** No AML/CTF or sanctions compliance policy documented.\n\n**Gap:** Lack of foundational financial crime prevention controls required for all financial services businesses in the Isle of Man.\n\n**Impact:** High risk of facilitating money laundering or terrorist financing, leading to severe regulatory penalties, criminal liability for directors, and loss of correspondent banking relationships.\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement a full AML/CTF/Sanctions Policy aligned with Isle of Man AML/CFT Code and Proceeds of Crime Act 2008. This must include customer risk assessment, KYC procedures, ongoing monitoring, screening against sanctions lists, and appointment of a Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO).\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Clear, fair, and non-misleading disclosures to users regarding the stablecoin's operation, risks, redemption rights, and reserve backing.\n\n**Recommendation:** Create a Consumer Disclosure Policy mandating clear terms of service, a prominent risk warning, details on redemption mechanics, and regular public attestations on reserve status. All marketing materials must be pre-approved for compliance.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Implementation of comprehensive risk management frameworks covering operational, cyber, liquidity, and market risks specific to stablecoin operations.\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop a Stablecoin-Specific Risk Management Framework. This should establish a risk governance structure, define risk appetite, and detail controls for IT security, business continuity, liquidity management, and third-party vendor risk.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-006\n**Requirement:** Adherence to data protection laws (Isle of Man GDPR equivalent) for processing personal data of users.\n\n**Recommendation:** Draft and implement a Data Protection & Privacy Policy compliant with the Isle of Man's GDPR framework. This must cover lawful basis for processing, data subject rights, data retention schedules, and breach notification procedures.\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **Regulatory Authorization & Licensing**: not_met\n❌ **Reserve Management & Audits**: not_met\n❌ **AML/CTF/Sanctions Compliance**: not_met\n❌ **Consumer Disclosures & Market Conduct**: not_met\n❌ **Risk Management Framework**: not_met\n❌ **Data Protection & Privacy**: not_met\n❌ **Corporate Governance**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update Summary\nGenerated: 2026-02-11T20:49:10.036828\n\n## Overview\nThis document summarizes proposed updates to company policies and standards based on regulatory gap analysis.\n\n## New Policies Required\n\n## Modified Policies\n\n### GAP-001\n**Category:** Compliance\n**Current Policy:** No documented policy regarding regulatory authorization or licensing requirements.\n**Proposed Change:** Immediately establish a policy requiring formal application to IOMFSA for appropriate authorization before any stablecoin issuance.

All marketing materials must be pre-approved for compliance.\n\n### GAP-005\n**Category:** Risk Management\n**Current Policy:** No enterprise or operational risk management policy in place.\n**Proposed Change:** Develop a Stablecoin-Specific Risk Management Framework. This should establish a risk governance structure, define risk appetite, and detail controls for IT security, business continuity, liquidity management, and third-party vendor risk.\n\n### GAP-006\n**Category:** Data Protection\n**Current Policy:** No data protection or privacy policy documented.\n**Proposed Change:** Draft and implement a Data Protection & Privacy Policy compliant with the Isle of Man's GDPR framework.
