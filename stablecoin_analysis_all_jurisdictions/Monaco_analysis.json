Reports will be drafted by responsible operational units, reviewed by Compliance, approved by the CCO, and submitted on time.\n4.  **Material Change Notification:** Any material change to the stablecoin’s model, technology, or governance will be assessed for regulatory impact and reported to the CCAF as required by the license conditions.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n*   **Mandatory Authorization:** No stablecoin issuance activity may commence prior to receiving formal CCAF authorization.\n*   **Training:** All relevant staff must complete training on this policy and associated regulatory obligations annually.\n*   **Record Keeping:** All documentation related to the application, correspondence with the CCAF, and ongoing reports must be retained for a minimum of ten years.\n*   **Breach Reporting:** Any suspected or actual breach of licensing conditions or this policy must be reported immediately to the CCO.\n*   **Audit:** The process and adherence to this policy will be subject to internal audit review at least bi-annually.\n\n## 7.

All fundamental regulatory requirements are unmet, creating severe legal, operational, and reputational risks. Immediate action is required to: 1) Engage with Monegasque regulators (CCAF) to understand licensing requirements, 2) Develop comprehensive compliance program aligned with EU MiCA regulation, and 3) Implement AML/CFT framework. The company should suspend any stablecoin operations until basic regulatory requirements are addressed to avoid severe enforcement actions.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance requires authorization/license from Monegasque authorities (Monaco does not have a central bank; financial regulation falls under French/EU frameworks and Commission de Contrôle des Activités Financières - CCAF)\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of licensing/authorization framework for stablecoin operations in Monaco\n\n**Impact:** Operating without authorization could result in regulatory enforcement, fines, business suspension, and reputational damage\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Engage with CCAF to understand authorization requirements 2. Develop licensing application framework 3. Create policy for ongoing regulatory reporting\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Compliance with EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) which Monaco must align with as part of monetary agreement with France\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found\n\n**Gap:** No policies addressing MiCA requirements for stablecoin issuers including capital requirements, reserve management, and consumer protection\n\n**Impact:** Non-compliance with MiCA could lead to EU-wide enforcement actions, significant fines (up to 5-10% of annual turnover), and market access restrictions\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Conduct MiCA gap analysis 2. Develop comprehensive compliance program covering Articles 16-35 of MiCA 3. Implement reserve management and redemption policies\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance under Monaco's Law No. 1.362 and alignment with EU AML Directives\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found\n\n**Gap:** No AML/CFT framework specific to stablecoin operations including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting\n\n**Impact:** Exposure to money laundering risks, regulatory sanctions, loss of banking relationships, and potential criminal liability\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Develop risk-based AML/CFT program 2. Implement customer identification and verification procedures 3. Establish transaction monitoring system 4. Designate AML compliance officer\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection requirements including clear disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Develop consumer disclosure documents 2. Create redemption policy and procedures 3. Establish complaint handling mechanism 4. Implement terms of service addressing consumer rights\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Reserve management and audit requirements for asset-backed stablecoins\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Develop reserve management policy 2. Establish custody arrangements 3. Implement regular independent audits 4. Create public reporting framework for reserve status\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-006\n**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity requirements\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Develop comprehensive cybersecurity policy 2. Implement incident response plan 3. Establish business continuity framework 4. Conduct regular security assessments\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **licensing_authorization**: not_met\n❌ **mica_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **aml_cft_framework**: not_met\n❌ **consumer_protection**: not_met\n❌ **reserve_management**: not_met\n❌ **operational_risk**: not_met\n❌ **governance_controls**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update Summary\nGenerated: 2026-02-06T03:38:29.588782\n\n## Overview\nThis document summarizes proposed updates to company policies and standards based on regulatory gap analysis.\n\n## New Policies Required\n\n## Modified Policies\n\n### GAP-001\n**Category:** Compliance\n**Current Policy:** No documented policy found\n**Proposed Change:** 1.
