# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T23:23:46.682258

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits a complete lack of policies and procedures for stablecoin operations in Germany, representing critical compliance failures across all regulatory domains. Immediate action is required to address fundamental licensing and AML gaps before any stablecoin activities can proceed. The company is currently non-compliant with German financial regulations and would face severe regulatory consequences if operating in this space. A phased remediation approach should prioritize licensing strategy and AML compliance, followed by implementation of operational and consumer protection frameworks.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** BaFin licensing requirement for stablecoin issuance and custody services under the German Banking Act (KWG) and Electronic Securities Act (eWpG)

**Current Status:** No documented policy for stablecoin operations

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing licensing requirements for issuing, managing, or providing custody services for stablecoins in Germany

**Impact:** Potential enforcement actions, fines, cease-and-desist orders, and criminal liability for operating without required authorization

**Recommendation:** Immediately suspend any stablecoin-related activities until licensing requirements are assessed. Develop a comprehensive licensing strategy document outlining steps to obtain BaFin authorization.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance under German Money Laundering Act (GwG) for stablecoin transactions

**Current Status:** No AML/KYC policies specific to crypto assets or stablecoins

**Gap:** Lack of customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting procedures for stablecoin operations

**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties, loss of banking relationships, reputational damage, and potential criminal prosecution

**Recommendation:** Develop and implement a crypto-specific AML/CFT program including KYC procedures, transaction monitoring, PEP screening, and reporting mechanisms compliant with GwG.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Capital requirements and reserve backing for stablecoin issuers under EU MiCA framework (applicable from 2024)

**Recommendation:** Create capital adequacy policy meeting MiCA requirements, establish segregated reserve accounts, and implement regular reporting on reserve composition and sufficiency.

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements including clear terms of redemption, risks, and fees

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive consumer documentation including clear redemption rights, risk factors, fee transparency, and complaint handling procedures.

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Governance and risk management framework for stablecoin operations

**Recommendation:** Establish a crypto governance committee, implement risk management framework with regular reporting, and develop comprehensive operational controls.
