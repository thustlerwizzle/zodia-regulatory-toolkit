Policy Statement\nIt is the policy of this organization to prohibit the active offering, issuance, or provision of stablecoin services to residents or within the territory of Western Sahara until a comprehensive, jurisdiction-specific legal framework has been established, formally approved, and implemented. The company is committed to the highest standards of legal compliance and regulatory adherence. No stablecoin operations shall commence in Western Sahara without explicit, documented confirmation from local legal counsel that all activities are fully compliant with all extant and applicable local regulations.\n\n## 5. Procedures\nTo implement this policy, the following procedures shall be followed:\n\n### 5.1 Phase 1: Regulatory Research & Analysis\n1. **Engagement of Local Counsel:** The Legal Department shall formally engage one or more reputable local legal counsel firms in Western Sahara.\n2. **Research Mandate:** Counsel will be tasked with providing a comprehensive report detailing:\n    - The status of digital asset regulation (including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and virtual asset service providers).\n    - Financial services, payment systems, and electronic money regulations.\n    - Securities, banking, and anti-money laundering (AML) / counter-financing of terrorism (CFT) laws.\n    - Licensing requirements for issuing, transferring, or exchanging value.\n    - Tax treatment of digital asset transactions.\n    - Any relevant administrative or judicial precedents.\n3. **Documentation:** All findings, legal opinions, and regulatory texts shall be securely archived in the company’s legal repository.\n\n### 5.2 Phase 2: Policy Framework Development\n1. **Drafting:** Based on the legal research, the Legal and Compliance Departments will draft a jurisdiction-specific addendum to this master policy. This addendum will detail permitted activities, licensing requirements, operational standards, risk controls, and reporting obligations specific to Western Sahara.\n2. **Internal Review:** The draft framework will be reviewed by relevant internal stakeholders (Risk, Technology, Operations).\n3. **Final Approval:** The final policy addendum requires sign-off by the Chief Legal Officer and Chief Compliance Officer.\n\n### 5.3 Phase 3: Implementation of Geographic Restrictions\n1. **Technical Controls:** Immediately upon this policy's enactment, the Technology Department shall implement IP address blocking, GPS-based location checks, and other reasonable technical measures to prevent access to stablecoin services from within Western Sahara.\n2. **User Onboarding:** Customer onboarding processes (KYC) must include explicit checks and declarations of residency. Accounts must be rejected if the user is a resident of or operating from Western Sahara.\n3. **Ongoing Monitoring:** Compliance will monitor for circumvention attempts (e.g., VPN usage) and update technical controls as necessary.\n\n### 5.4 Phase 4: Future Commencement of Services\nShould the regulatory landscape permit future operations, a separate project plan will be initiated. This will include applying for necessary licenses, implementing the approved jurisdiction-specific policy, testing systems, training staff, and obtaining final executive authorization before launching any services.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n- **Mandatory Adherence:** All personnel must adhere strictly to this policy. Violations may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.\n- **Certification:** Relevant department heads must certify quarterly that the geographic restrictions remain active and effective.\n- **Reporting:** Any inquiry, business opportunity, or potential contact related to stablecoins and Western Sahara must be reported immediately to the Compliance Department.\n- **Third-Party Management:** All contracts with third-party vendors (e.g., liquidity providers, marketing agencies) must include clauses obligating them to comply with this geographic restriction.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule\nThis policy shall be reviewed and updated:\n- **Annually** as part of the company’s standard policy review cycle.\n- **Immediately** upon notification of a material change in the legal or regulatory environment of Western Sahara, as advised by local counsel.\n- **Prior to** any consideration of launching services in the jurisdiction.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements\nThis policy is designed to be dynamically linked to the regulatory requirements of Western Sahara. The specific references will be contained within the jurisdiction-specific addendum developed under Phase 2. Until such an addendum exists, this policy operates under the default assumption that the regulatory status is either **prohibitive, unclear, or undeveloped**, thereby mandating a restriction on services.\n\n**Policy Version:** 1.0  \n**Effective Date:** [Date of Board Approval]  \n**Approved By:** [Signature of Chief Legal Officer & Chief Compliance Officer]\n```"

Definitions\n- **Stablecoin:** A type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified asset or pool of assets, typically a fiat currency like the Moroccan Dirham (MAD) or a basket of currencies.\n- **Reserve Assets:** The high-quality, liquid assets held to fully back the outstanding supply of stablecoins at a 1:1 or greater ratio.\n- **Reserve Requirement:** The minimum amount and quality of assets that must be held in reserve against stablecoin liabilities, as determined by local regulatory research.\n- **Custodian:** A regulated financial institution responsible for safeguarding the reserve assets.\n- **Issuer:** The entity that creates, issues, and manages the redemption of the stablecoin.\n- **Western Sahara:** For the purposes of this policy, refers to the geographic territory and its resident population.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\nIt is the policy of the Issuer to maintain at all times a reserve of high-quality, liquid assets that fully backs 100% of the outstanding stablecoins in circulation, plus a prudent additional buffer as determined by ongoing local regulatory research. The reserve will be segregated from the Issuer's operational funds, held with reputable, regulated custodians, and managed with the primary objectives of safety, liquidity, and compliance with all applicable standards in Western Sahara. Transparency through regular, verifiable reporting is a fundamental commitment.\n\n## 5. Procedures\n\n### 5.1 Phase 1: Research and Analysis\n1. **Regulatory Landscape Assessment:** A dedicated compliance officer will conduct ongoing research to identify and monitor any formal or informal reserve requirements, financial regulations, and monetary policies applicable in Western Sahara.

Compliance Requirements\n\n### 6.1 Audit Procedures\n1. **Monthly Attestation:** An internal audit will be conducted monthly to verify reserve balances and composition.\n2. **Quarterly Independent Audit:** A reputable, independent third-party audit firm will perform a detailed quarterly examination of the reserve holdings and issue a public attestation report confirming the 1:1+ backing.\n3. **Scope of Audit:** Audits will verify asset existence, ownership, valuation, custody arrangements, and compliance with this policy's reserve composition rules.\n\n### 6.2 Reporting Procedures\n1. **Public Reporting:** A detailed reserve report, including the total value and breakdown of assets by type and custodian, will be published on the Issuer's website within 14 days of each month's end.\n2. **Regulatory Reporting:** If and as required by local authorities in Western Sahara, specific reports will be submitted in the prescribed format and timeline.\n3. **Real-Time Transparency:** Where feasible, an aggregated view of reserve holdings will be made available via a public dashboard.\n\n### 6.3 Roles and Responsibilities\n- **Board of Directors:** Ultimate oversight of policy adherence and reserve safety.\n- **Chief Compliance Officer:** Responsible for regulatory research, policy implementation, and audit coordination.\n- **Treasury Manager:** Responsible for day-to-day reserve management and rebalancing.\n- **Internal Auditor:** Responsible for executing monthly internal attestations.\n\n## 7.

References to Regulatory Requirements\nThis policy is proactively designed to conform to:\n- General principles of financial integrity and consumer protection as anticipated for emerging digital asset frameworks in the Western Sahara region.\n- Core reserve management standards as outlined by international bodies such as the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) for stablecoin arrangements.\n- Specific local regulatory requirements, which will be incorporated by reference as they are formally identified and promulgated by relevant authorities in Western Sahara.
