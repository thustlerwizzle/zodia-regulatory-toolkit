Purpose and Scope\n### 2.1 Purpose\nThis policy establishes a comprehensive framework for the management, custody, segregation, and independent verification of reserves backing issued stablecoins. Its primary purpose is to ensure full backing at all times with high-quality liquid assets, protect user funds, maintain operational resilience, and ensure strict compliance with relevant regulations, including the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) Articles 36-38.\n\n### 2.2 Scope\nThis policy applies to all issued asset-referenced tokens (e-money tokens and other significant stablecoins as defined under MiCA). It is binding for all personnel involved in treasury management, finance, compliance, risk, and operations. It governs all activities related to the composition, custody, segregation, and auditing of the reserve portfolio.\n\n## 3. Definitions\n*   **Asset-Referenced Token (ART):** A type of crypto-asset that purports to maintain a stable value by referencing the value of several fiat currencies, one or more commodities, one or more crypto-assets, or a basket of such assets.\n*   **E-money Token (EMT):** A type of crypto-asset that purports to maintain a stable value by referencing the value of a single fiat currency.\n*   **Reserve Assets:** The pool of high-quality liquid assets held to fully back the outstanding stablecoins in circulation.\n*   **High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA):** Assets that are low risk, easy to value, and can be liquidated rapidly with minimal loss of value under stress conditions, as defined in Section 5.1.\n*   **Segregation of Funds:** The legal and operational separation of reserve assets from the issuer's own assets and from the assets of other entities, held for the sole benefit of the stablecoin holders.\n*   **Independent Auditor:** A qualified, external audit firm with relevant expertise, appointed to conduct regular attestations and audits of the reserve.\n*   **Outstanding Amount:** The total nominal value of all stablecoins in circulation held by the public.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\nIt is the firm's unequivocal policy to maintain at all times a reserve of assets whose aggregate value equals or exceeds the aggregate outstanding amount of the issued stablecoins. These reserve assets shall be:\n1.  Composed exclusively of **High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA)**.\n2.  Held in **segregated accounts** under a robust custody framework, distinct from the company's operational funds.\n3.  Subject to **daily internal reconciliation** and **monthly independent attestation**.\n4.  Audited **quarterly** by an independent, qualified auditor, with results published for transparency.\n5.  Managed with the paramount objective of **safety, liquidity, and stability**, prioritizing capital preservation over yield generation.\n\n## 5. Procedures\n\n### 5.1 Eligible Reserve Assets\nThe reserve portfolio must consist solely of the following asset classes, subject to the stated concentration limits:\n*   **Cash and Cash Equivalents:**\n    *   Deposits held at credit institutions.\n    *   Sovereign debt securities (e.g., EU Member State bonds, US Treasuries) with a credit quality step of 1 under Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR) and residual maturity ≤ 12 months.\n*   **High-Quality Debt Instruments:**\n    *   Debt instruments issued by national governments, central banks, or multilateral development banks with a credit quality step of 1.\n    *   High-quality corporate bonds with a credit quality step of 1, subject to a maximum of 10% of total reserves.\n*   **Money Market Fund (MMF) Shares:** Shares in qualifying MMFs as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1131, subject to a maximum of 10% of total reserves.\n*   **Prohibited Assets:** Under no circumstances shall the reserve include crypto-assets, own-equity instruments, illiquid assets, or assets issued by related parties.\n\n### 5.2 Custody and Segregation Requirements\n1.  **Legal Segregation:** Reserve assets must be legally ring-fenced, held in bankruptcy-remote structures (e.g., dedicated trust or special purpose vehicle) for the exclusive benefit of stablecoin holders.\n2.  **Custodial Arrangements:**\n    *   All reserve assets must be held with regulated, creditworthy custodians (e.g., credit institutions, MiFID investment firms, or qualified crypto-asset service providers for relevant instruments).\n    *   A minimum of two independent, top-tier custodians must be used to mitigate concentration risk.\n    *   Custody agreements must explicitly acknowledge the segregated nature of the assets and the rights of stablecoin holders.\n3.  **Operational Segregation:** Internal accounting and ledger systems must clearly and separately track reserve assets from corporate assets. Access controls must limit system access to authorized treasury and finance personnel only.\n\n### 5.3 Reserve Management & Valuation\n1.  **Valuation:** Reserve assets must be valued daily at their mark-to-market or mark-to-model value in accordance with applicable financial reporting standards.\n2.  **Liquidity Requirement:** A minimum of 10% of the reserve must be held in assets that can be converted into cash within one business day without significant loss to meet potential rapid redemptions.\n3.  **Reconciliation:** The Treasury Department must perform a daily reconciliation between the total outstanding stablecoins and the total market value of the reserve assets. Any shortfall must be remedied immediately by injecting eligible assets.\n4.  **Investment Strategy:** The primary objective is capital preservation. Any investment activity must be pre-approved by the Asset-Liability Committee (ALCO) and adhere strictly to the eligible assets list and concentration limits.\n\n### 5.4 Audit and Reporting Frequency\n1.  **Monthly Attestation:** An independent auditor shall perform a monthly attestation on the management's assertion that the value of the reserve assets was at least equal to the outstanding amount at the end of each calendar month. A summary shall be published on the company website within 10 business days.\n2.  **Quarterly Audit:** A full-scope independent audit of the reserve shall be conducted quarterly. The audit report must include an opinion on the existence, ownership, valuation, and segregation of the reserve assets.\n3.  **Annual Comprehensive Audit:** As part of the annual financial statement audit, the reserve will be subject to a comprehensive audit in line with MiCA Article 38.\n4.  **Publication:** All audit and attestation reports shall be published on the company's website in a prominent and easily accessible manner.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n*   The Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) is responsible for overseeing adherence to this policy.\n*   The Treasury Department is responsible for day-to-day implementation and daily reconciliation.\n*   Any breach of this policy, including any reserve shortfall, must be escalated immediately to the CCO, Chief Risk Officer (CRO), and CEO.

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Belgium\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-01-30T18:50:28.334193\n\n## Executive Summary\nCRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no documented policies addressing Belgian/EU stablecoin regulations. All fundamental regulatory requirements are unmet, creating severe legal, operational, and reputational risks. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive regulatory compliance framework before any stablecoin operations can commence in Belgium. The most critical gaps requiring immediate attention are authorization requirements, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance. Without addressing these foundational gaps, the company cannot legally operate in the Belgian market and faces significant regulatory enforcement risks.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Authorization as a payment institution or electronic money institution for stablecoin issuance in Belgium (under EU-wide frameworks like MiCA - Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation)\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing authorization requirements for stablecoin issuance or provision of crypto-asset services in Belgium/EU\n\n**Impact:** Legal prohibition from operating, severe regulatory penalties, potential criminal liability for unauthorized financial services\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive authorization framework policy outlining requirements under MiCA and Belgian financial regulations, including application procedures, capital requirements, and governance standards\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin reserve requirements (full backing with high-quality liquid assets, segregation of funds, regular independent audits)\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found\n\n**Gap:** No policies governing reserve management, asset segregation, or audit requirements for stablecoin backing\n\n**Impact:** Risk of insolvency, loss of consumer funds, regulatory enforcement actions, loss of market confidence\n\n**Recommendation:** Create detailed reserve management policy specifying eligible assets, custody arrangements, segregation requirements, and audit frequency in line with MiCA Article 36-38\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance (customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, reporting obligations under Belgian AML law)\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing policies required for crypto-asset service providers\n\n**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, potential criminal prosecution, loss of banking relationships, inclusion in blacklists\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop and implement full AML/CFT program aligned with Belgian Financial Intelligence Processing Unit (CTIF-CFI) requirements and EU AML directives\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures (transparency requirements, redemption rights, complaint handling)\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive consumer protection policy covering whitepaper requirements, redemption procedures, fee transparency, and complaint resolution mechanisms\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity requirements\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish operational resilience framework covering cybersecurity standards, business continuity planning, and incident response procedures\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-006\n**Requirement:** Governance and risk management framework\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive governance policy covering board composition, risk management framework, internal controls, and compliance monitoring\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **authorization_requirements**: not_met\n❌ **reserve_requirements**: not_met\n❌ **consumer_protection**: not_met\n❌ **aml_cft_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **operational_resilience**:
