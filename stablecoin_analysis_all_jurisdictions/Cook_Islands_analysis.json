All fundamental regulatory requirements for stablecoin operations remain unaddressed. Immediate action is required to establish a comprehensive compliance framework before engaging in any stablecoin-related activities. The most critical gaps relate to licensing, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance, which could result in severe regulatory consequences if not addressed promptly. The company should prioritize developing core policies while conducting thorough jurisdictional research on Cook Islands' specific regulatory requirements for digital assets."

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Cook Islands\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-02-12T13:07:02.610735\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company exhibits a complete absence of stablecoin-specific compliance policies, representing critical regulatory exposure. All fundamental regulatory requirements for stablecoin operations remain unaddressed. Immediate action is required to establish a comprehensive compliance framework before engaging in any stablecoin-related activities. The most critical gaps relate to licensing, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance, which could result in severe regulatory consequences if not addressed promptly. The company should prioritize developing core policies while conducting thorough jurisdictional research on Cook Islands' specific regulatory requirements for digital assets.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance requires licensing/registration with financial regulator\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy for stablecoin issuance or regulatory registration\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policy framework for stablecoin operations and regulatory engagement\n\n**Impact:** Potential for regulatory enforcement actions, fines, business suspension, and reputational damage\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish a regulatory engagement policy that includes: 1) Licensing requirements assessment 2) Application procedures 3) Regulatory relationship management\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Reserve requirements for stablecoin issuers (typically 1:1 backing with high-quality liquid assets)\n\n**Current Status:** No reserve management or asset backing policies\n\n**Gap:** Missing framework for reserve composition, custody, auditing, and transparency\n\n**Impact:** Risk of insolvency, loss of peg, consumer harm, and regulatory sanctions\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive reserve management policy covering: 1) Eligible asset types 2) Custody arrangements 3) Regular attestations/audits 4) Public disclosure requirements\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and reporting\n\n**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT program for stablecoin operations\n\n**Gap:** Lack of financial crime prevention framework specific to digital assets\n\n**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties, loss of banking relationships, and potential criminal liability\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement a digital asset-specific AML/CFT program including: 1) Risk assessment 2) KYC/CDD procedures 3) Transaction monitoring 4) Suspicious activity reporting\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling\n\n**Recommendation:** Create consumer protection policy covering: 1) Clear product disclosures 2) Redemption procedures 3) Complaint resolution 4) Risk communication\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Operational risk management including cybersecurity, business continuity, and technology governance\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish digital asset operational risk framework including: 1) Cybersecurity standards 2) Smart contract security 3) Business continuity planning 4) Third-party risk management\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **licensing_registration**: not_met\n❌ **reserve_requirements**: not_met\n❌ **aml_cft_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **consumer_protection**: not_met\n❌ **operational_risk**: not_met\n❌ **cross_border_compliance**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update Summary\nGenerated:
