This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Transnistria\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-02-12T18:19:47.351102\n\n## Executive Summary\nCRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no policies addressing stablecoin operations in Transnistria, representing a complete regulatory compliance failure. All fundamental regulatory requirements for stablecoin issuance and operation are unmet. Immediate action is required to: 1) Suspend any current operations until regulatory clarity is obtained, 2) Conduct comprehensive regulatory research on Transnistria's specific requirements, 3) Develop a complete compliance framework before resuming operations. The absence of basic policies for legal authorization, reserve management, AML/CTF, and consumer protection creates severe legal, financial, and reputational risks.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Legal recognition and authorization to issue stablecoins in Transnistria\n\n**Current Status:** No policy exists regarding stablecoin operations in Transnistria\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing the legal framework for stablecoin issuance, operation, or compliance in Transnistria\n\n**Impact:** Operating without legal authorization could result in regulatory enforcement, fines, business shutdown, and reputational damage\n\n**Recommendation:** Immediately suspend any stablecoin operations in Transnistria until legal research confirms regulatory requirements and develop authorization policies\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Reserve requirements and asset backing for stablecoins\n\n**Current Status:** No documented reserve management or asset backing policies\n\n**Gap:** Missing policies governing reserve composition, custody, auditing, and redemption mechanisms required for stablecoin operations\n\n**Impact:** Failure to maintain adequate reserves could lead to insolvency, loss of consumer funds, and regulatory sanctions\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive reserve management policies including: 1) Minimum reserve requirements, 2) Permissible reserve assets, 3) Custody arrangements, 4) Regular auditing procedures, 5) Redemption mechanisms\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance\n\n**Current Status:** No specific AML/CTF policies for stablecoin operations\n\n**Gap:** Missing customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and record-keeping requirements specific to stablecoin transactions\n\n**Impact:** Exposure to financial crime risks, regulatory penalties, loss of banking relationships, and potential criminal liability\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement stablecoin-specific AML/CTF program including: 1) Customer identification and verification, 2) Transaction monitoring thresholds, 3) Suspicious activity reporting procedures, 4) Travel rule compliance for cross-border transactions\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop consumer protection framework including: 1) Clear risk disclosures, 2) Terms of service documentation, 3) Redemption process transparency, 4) Complaint resolution procedures, 5) Educational materials for users\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish operational risk management framework including: 1) Smart contract security audits, 2) Cryptographic key management, 3) System redundancy requirements, 4) Incident response plan, 5) Business continuity testing\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-006\n**Requirement:** Reporting and transparency obligations\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement reporting framework including: 1) Regulatory reporting schedules, 2) Public reserve attestations, 3) Financial statement disclosures, 4) Incident reporting protocols\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌
