Based on standard financial regulatory frameworks and emerging digital asset regulations, all critical regulatory areas are unaddressed. The company is operating in a state of significant regulatory non-compliance with exposure to enforcement actions, financial penalties, operational shutdowns, and criminal liability. Immediate development of a comprehensive regulatory compliance program is required before any stablecoin operations should commence. Given New Caledonia's status as a French territory, EU regulatory frameworks (particularly MiCA - Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation) should be considered as a baseline, along with French financial regulations and any local Pacific Island financial service requirements."

Purpose and Scope\n### 2.1 Purpose\nThis policy establishes a comprehensive framework to ensure that all issued stablecoins are fully backed by adequate reserves at all times. Its primary objectives are to:\n*   Maintain 1:1 parity between issued stablecoins and the value of the underlying reserve assets.\n*   Ensure the safety, liquidity, and low-risk profile of reserve assets.\n*   Provide transparency and accountability to regulators, users, and the public.\n*   Define clear procedures for the secure custody, independent audit, and timely redemption of stablecoins.\n\n### 2.2 Scope\nThis policy applies to all activities related to the issuance, reserve backing, and redemption of [Company Name]'s stablecoin, [Stablecoin Ticker/Name]. It is binding on all employees, contractors, and third-party service providers involved in treasury management, finance, compliance, and related functions.\n\n## 3. Definitions\n*   **Issued Stablecoins:** The total number of [Stablecoin Ticker/Name] tokens in circulation.\n*   **Reserve Assets:** The pool of high-quality, liquid assets held to back the value of all issued stablecoins.\n*   **Reserve Ratio:** The ratio of the fair market value of Reserve Assets to the aggregate face value of Issued Stablecoins, expressed as a percentage. The target is ≥100%.\n*   **Qualified Custodian:** A regulated financial institution specializing in the secure safeguarding of financial assets for others.\n*   **Authorized Redemption:** The process by which a verified holder exchanges [Stablecoin Ticker/Name] for its equivalent value in the designated redemption currency.\n*   **Independent Auditor:** A reputable, third-party accounting firm with relevant expertise, engaged to provide an objective attestation on the reserve status.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\n[Company Name] is committed to operating with full transparency and the highest standards of financial integrity. We hereby mandate that the value of Issued Stablecoins will be backed at all times by an equivalent fair market value of Reserve Assets, held in segregated accounts with Qualified Custodians. The composition, custody, and sufficiency of these reserves will be subject to regular independent audit, with results disclosed to the public.\n\n## 5. Procedures\n### 5.1 Reserve Composition Requirements\n*   **Primary Assets (Minimum 80% of Reserve):** Must be comprised of:\n    *   Cash and cash equivalents (e.g., demand deposits, Treasury bills with < 3-month maturity).\n    *   Short-term government securities (rated A- or higher by a major credit rating agency, with maturity ≤ 1 year).\n*   **Secondary Assets (Maximum 20% of Reserve):** May include:\n    *   High-grade commercial paper (rated A-2/P-2 or higher, maturity ≤ 90 days).\n    *   Deposits at regulated financial institutions.\n    *   Other highly liquid, low-risk instruments as pre-approved by the Board Risk Committee.\n*   **Prohibited Assets:** Cryptocurrencies (other than for operational wallets), equities, derivatives, illiquid securities, and assets issued by related parties are strictly prohibited.\n\n### 5.2 Custody Arrangements\n*   All Reserve Assets must be held under a clear segregation of assets model, explicitly designated for the benefit of stablecoin holders.\n*   Assets must be held with one or more Qualified Custodians, selected through a formal due diligence process.\n*   The Treasury Department must maintain a daily ledger reconciling Issued Stablecoins with the documented value of Reserve Assets held in custody.\n\n### 5.3 Independent Audit Requirements\n*   The company must engage an Independent Auditor to perform a **monthly attestation review**.\n*   The auditor will verify the existence, ownership, and valuation of Reserve Assets and confirm the Reserve Ratio as of the month-end date.\n*   A **full annual audit**, in accordance with recognized auditing standards (e.g., AICPA SOC 2), must be conducted and published.\n\n### 5.4 Public Disclosure Protocols\n*   A **Public Reserve Dashboard** will be maintained on the company's official website, updated at least weekly with:\n    *   The total value of Issued Stablecoins.\n    *   The total fair market value and detailed composition of Reserve Assets.\n    *   The current Reserve Ratio.\n*   The monthly attestation report from the Independent Auditor will be published on the website within **10 business days** of receipt.\n*   The annual audit report will be published within **30 days** of completion.\n\n### 5.5 Redemption Procedures\n*   A clear, publicly available redemption mechanism will be provided for all verified holders.\n*   Redemption requests will be processed within a standard service level of [e.g., 2-5 business days] for fiat currency, subject to anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) checks.\n*   The Treasury Department will ensure sufficient liquid assets are available to meet normal redemption demand without impacting the overall reserve composition requirements.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n*   The Chief Financial Officer (CFO) is the policy owner and is responsible for its implementation and day-to-day oversight.\n*   The Compliance Department is responsible for monitoring adherence to this policy and relevant regulatory requirements.\n*   Any breach of the minimum Reserve Ratio, custody rules, or audit schedule constitutes a **Severity 1 incident** and must be escalated immediately to the CEO and Board, with a corrective action plan developed within 24 hours.\n*   Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.\n\n## 7.

Procedures  \n\n### 5.1 Smart Contract Security Protocols\n1. **Development & Design:**  \n   - All smart contracts must undergo formal specification and design review prior to coding.\n   - Use established, audited standards (e.g., OpenZeppelin libraries) where possible.\n2. **Testing & Auditing:**  \n   - Implement a multi-stage testing regime: unit tests, integration tests, and testnet deployment.\n   - All production smart contracts must undergo a professional, independent security audit prior to mainnet deployment. Critical findings must be remediated.\n3. **Deployment & Governance:**  \n   - Use multi-signature wallets or decentralized governance for contract deployment and upgrades.\n   - Maintain an immutable audit trail of all deployments and upgrades.\n4. **Monitoring:**  \n   - Continuously monitor contract activity and function calls for anomalous behavior using blockchain analytics tools.\n\n### 5.2 Private Key Management and Storage\n1. **Key Generation:**  \n   - Keys must be generated using certified, cryptographically secure random number generators in isolated, secure environments.\n2. **Storage Standards:**  \n   - Implement a tiered wallet structure based on risk and function (e.g., hot wallets for liquidity, cold storage for reserves).\n   - Cold storage private keys must be stored offline using Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) or air-gapped computers. Physical media (e.g., metal plates) must be stored in geographically dispersed, high-security vaults.\n3. **Access Control:**  \n   - Enforce strict principle of least privilege. Access to private keys requires MFA and is limited to authorized personnel only.\n   - Use multi-signature (multi-sig) schemes for all significant treasury and reserve transactions, with key shards held by separate custodians.\n4. **Lifecycle Management:**  \n   - Establish secure procedures for key rotation, revocation, and destruction.\n\n### 5.3 System Redundancy and Disaster Recovery\n1. **Architecture:**  \n   - Design all critical systems for high availability with no single point of failure.\n   - Deploy nodes and validators across multiple cloud providers and/or geographic regions.\n2. **Backups:**  \n   - Perform encrypted, frequent backups of all critical data, configurations, and state. Test backup restoration quarterly.\n3. **Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP):**  \n   - Maintain a documented DRP for digital asset operations, including clear Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO).\n   - Conduct full-scale DRP exercises at least annually.\n\n### 5.4 Cybersecurity Controls\n1. **Network & Endpoint Security:**  \n   - Segment networks; employ firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools.\n2. **Access Management:**  \n   - Enforce role-based access control (RBAC), mandatory MFA for all systems, and regular access reviews.\n3. **Vulnerability Management:**  \n   - Conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests on all internet-facing and critical internal systems. Remediate findings based on risk priority.\n4. **Third-Party Risk:**  \n   - Conduct due diligence on all third-party service providers (e.g., cloud hosts, auditors, wallet providers). Contracts must include cybersecurity and data protection requirements.\n\n### 5.5 Incident Response Procedures\n1. **Plan:**  \n   - Maintain a dedicated Digital Asset Incident Response Plan (IRP) integrated with the corporate IRP.\n2. **Team:**  \n   - Designate a cross-functional Incident Response Team with clear roles (Lead, Tech, Legal, Comms).\n3. **Process:**  \n   - Process shall include: Immediate containment, eradication, evidence preservation, notification to regulators/law enforcement as required, internal and external communication, post-incident analysis, and remediation.\n4. **Reporting:**  \n   - All employees must report suspected incidents immediately via the defined channel. Retaliation for good-faith reporting is prohibited.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements  \n- All personnel must acknowledge and adhere to this policy.\n- The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) or designee is responsible for oversight and enforcement.\n- Violations may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination, and potential legal consequences.\n- The organization will maintain documentation and logs to demonstrate compliance with this policy for regulatory examination.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule  \nThis policy shall be reviewed and updated **at least annually**, or more frequently in response to:\n- Significant security incidents\n- Changes in the digital asset threat landscape\n- Major changes to operational infrastructure\n- New or amended regulatory requirements  \nAll revisions require approval by the Board of Directors or designated Risk Committee.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements  \nThis policy is designed to align with principles and requirements set forth in (or anticipated by) relevant guidance, including but not limited to:\n- **Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) / Anti-Money Laundering (AML)** requirements for monitoring and reporting.\n- **New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) Part 200 (Virtual Currency)** and cybersecurity regulation (23 NYCRR 500).\n- **Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)** interpretive letters on digital asset activities.\n- **Financial Action Task Force (FATF)** Recommendations on Virtual Assets and VASPs.\n- **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** and **NIST IR 8278 (Digital Identity Guidelines)**.\n- Relevant state money transmitter laws and prospective federal stablecoin legislation.\n\n---\n**Policy Version:** 1.0  \n**Effective Date:** [Date]  \n**Approved By:** [Board of Directors / Risk Committee]  \n**Policy Owner:** Chief Risk Officer\n```"

  "report": "# Regulatory Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-02-12 13:06:52\n\n## Regulatory Requirements Summary\n\nRegulatory Research Summary\n\nNote: Limited research results were obtained. This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation New Caledonia\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-02-12T12:59:51.885970\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company exhibits a complete absence of policies addressing stablecoin regulatory requirements. Based on standard financial regulatory frameworks and emerging digital asset regulations, all critical regulatory areas are unaddressed. The company is operating in a state of significant regulatory non-compliance with exposure to enforcement actions, financial penalties, operational shutdowns, and criminal liability. Immediate development of a comprehensive regulatory compliance program is required before any stablecoin operations should commence. Given New Caledonia's status as a French territory, EU regulatory frameworks (particularly MiCA - Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation) should be considered as a baseline, along with French financial regulations and any local Pacific Island financial service requirements.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance and operation requires authorization from financial regulatory authorities (based on standard financial regulatory frameworks in developed jurisdictions)\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy for stablecoin issuance authorization\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policy addressing regulatory authorization requirements for issuing or operating stablecoins in New Caledonia or any jurisdiction\n\n**Impact:** Potential for regulatory enforcement actions, fines, license revocation, and criminal liability for unauthorized financial activities\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop and implement a regulatory authorization policy that includes: 1) Jurisdictional analysis for stablecoin operations, 2) Application process for regulatory approvals, 3) Ongoing compliance monitoring for authorization maintenance\n\n### Gap

peg, consumer harm, and regulatory sanctions for misleading representations about token backing\n\n**Recommendation:** Create comprehensive reserve management policy including: 1) Reserve composition requirements, 2) Custody arrangements, 3) Independent audit requirements, 4) Public disclosure protocols, 5) Redemption procedures\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance for virtual asset service providers (VASPs)\n\n**Current Status:** No documented AML/CTF policy for stablecoin operations\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of AML/CTF framework specific to stablecoin transactions, customer due diligence, or suspicious activity monitoring\n\n**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties, potential criminal liability, loss of banking relationships, and reputational damage\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop VASP-specific AML/CTF program including: 1) Customer identification and verification procedures, 2) Transaction monitoring systems, 3) Suspicious activity reporting protocols, 4) Record-keeping requirements, 5) Staff training programs\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including disclosures, risk warnings, and complaint handling\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive consumer protection framework including: 1) Clear risk disclosure documents, 2) Complaint handling procedures, 3) Redress mechanisms, 4) Marketing and advertising guidelines, 5) Customer education materials\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity requirements for digital asset operations\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish digital asset operational risk policy covering: 1) Smart contract security protocols, 2) Private key management and storage, 3) System redundancy and disaster recovery, 4) Cybersecurity controls, 5) Incident response procedures\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌
