Purpose and Scope\n### 2.1 Purpose\nThis policy establishes a formal framework for determining the legal definition and regulatory classification of stablecoins under Armenian law. Its purpose is to ensure that all operations, investments, and product offerings involving stablecoins are conducted in strict compliance with Armenian national regulations, guided by the directives of the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) and the Ministry of Finance (MoF).\n\n### 2.2 Scope\nThis policy applies to all departments, subsidiaries, and employees of [Company Name] involved in:\n*   The acquisition, custody, trading, or issuance of stablecoins.\n*   The development of financial products or services incorporating stablecoins.\n*   Legal, compliance, and risk management functions related to digital assets.\n*   Any third-party vendor or partner relationship where stablecoin classification is materially relevant to the engagement.\n\n## 3. Definitions\n*   **Stablecoin:** A type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified asset or a pool of assets, typically a fiat currency like the Armenian Dram (AMD) or the US Dollar (USD).\n*   **Central Bank of Armenia (CBA):** The national authority responsible for monetary policy, banking regulation, and payment system oversight in the Republic of Armenia.\n*   **Ministry of Finance (MoF):** The government ministry responsible for fiscal policy, financial legislation, and economic regulation in Armenia.\n*   **Legal Counsel:** The appointed Armenian law firm(s) or internal legal department tasked with regulatory research and interpretation.\n*   **Regulatory Classification:** The legal characterization of a stablecoin (e.g., as electronic money, a payment instrument, a security, a commodity, or a novel asset class) which dictates the applicable licensing, reporting, and operational requirements.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\n[Company Name] is committed to full regulatory compliance in all jurisdictions where it operates. In the absence of explicit, comprehensive stablecoin legislation in Armenia, the company will proactively seek authoritative guidance to inform its operations. No stablecoin-related activity shall be undertaken without first undergoing a classification assessment as outlined in this policy. Internal definitions and risk treatments will be based directly on the research and advice of qualified Armenian legal counsel and any available official guidance from the CBA and MoF.\n\n## 5. Procedures\n\n### 5.1 Engagement of Armenian Legal Counsel\n1.  The General Counsel or Chief Compliance Officer shall select and engage one or more reputable Armenian law firms with demonstrated expertise in financial regulation and digital assets.\n2.  The engagement letter must explicitly mandate the following deliverables:\n    *   A comprehensive memorandum analyzing the current Armenian legal landscape, including the Law on Payment and Payment Systems, Securities Market Law, Civil Code, and any relevant tax codes.\n    *   Identification of how existing regulations may apply to various stablecoin structures (e.g., fiat-collateralized, crypto-collateralized, algorithmic).\n    *   Documentation of any formal or informal guidance, statements, or rulings issued by the CBA or MoF regarding virtual assets and stablecoins.\n    *   A recommended internal classification framework for stablecoins based on the above research.\n\n### 5.2 Development of Internal Classification Framework\n1.  Upon receipt of the legal memorandum, the Legal and Compliance departments will convene a working group with Risk and relevant business units.\n2.  This group will draft an **Internal Stablecoin Classification Guide** that:\n    *   Categorizes stablecoins based on their legal status (e.g., \"Regulated Electronic Money,\" \"Unclassified Digital Asset,\" \"Potential Security\").\n    *   Defines the permissible actions, risk ratings, and control requirements for each category.\n    *   Establishes a due diligence checklist for vetting new stablecoins prior to company use or support.\n3.  The draft guide must be reviewed and approved by the engaged external legal counsel to ensure accuracy.\n\n### 5.3 Ongoing Monitoring and Assessment\n1.  The Compliance Department is responsible for maintaining a registry of all stablecoins assessed and their approved classification.\n2.  Prior to engaging with any new stablecoin, the responsible business unit must submit a \"Stablecoin Assessment Form\" to Compliance, triggering a review against the Internal Classification Guide.\n3.  Any material change in a stablecoin's structure, issuer, or governing law requires a re-assessment.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n*   **Mandatory Adherence:** All employees must comply with the controls and restrictions specified in the Internal Stablecoin Classification Guide.\n*   **Prohibition:** It is strictly prohibited to circumvent this policy by engaging in stablecoin activities through unapproved channels or without completing the classification assessment.\n*   **Reporting:** Any suspected change in Armenian regulatory stance, or any inquiry from the CBA or MoF, must be reported immediately to the Chief Compliance Officer.\n*   **Recordkeeping:** All legal memoranda, assessment forms, and classification decisions must be archived for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule\nThis policy and its accompanying Internal Classification Guide shall be reviewed at least **annually** by the Legal and Compliance departments. An ad-hoc review must be triggered immediately upon:\n*   The publication of new Armenian legislation or binding regulation concerning stablecoins or virtual assets.\n*   The issuance of formal guidance by the CBA or MoF.\n*   A material enforcement action related to stablecoins in Armenia.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements\nThis policy is designed to ensure alignment with existing and future Armenian regulatory frameworks, including but not limited to:\n*   The Central Bank of Armenia Law.\n*   The Law of the Republic of Armenia on Payment and Payment Systems.\n*   The Law of the Republic of Armenia on Securities Market.\n*   The Civil Code of the Republic of Armenia.\n*   Official communications, circulars, and regulatory sandbox frameworks issued by the CBA and MoF.\n*   Findings and interpretations provided by engaged Armenian legal counsel as mandated in Section 5.1.\n\n---\n**Policy Version:** 1.0  \n**Effective Date:** [Date]  \n**Approved By:** [Name, Title]  \n**Next Scheduled Review:** [Date, One Year from Effective Date]\n```"

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Armenia\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-01-30T05:47:26.115063\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company exhibits a complete lack of policies addressing Armenian stablecoin regulations. All regulatory requirements are currently unmet, creating critical compliance risks. Immediate action is required to develop foundational policies, particularly regarding legal classification and licensing. The company should prioritize engaging Armenian legal counsel and regulatory experts to understand the specific requirements before developing comprehensive compliance policies. Given Armenia's evolving regulatory landscape for digital assets, the company should also establish ongoing regulatory monitoring procedures to track new developments.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Legal definition and classification of stablecoins under Armenian law\n\n**Current Status:** No policy exists\n\n**Gap:** Company lacks policies defining stablecoins and their regulatory treatment in Armenia. No classification framework exists for determining if stablecoins are considered e-money, payment tokens, or other financial instruments.\n\n**Impact:** Operating without clear legal classification exposes company to regulatory enforcement, license revocation, fines, and potential criminal liability for unauthorized financial activities.\n\n**Recommendation:** Engage Armenian legal counsel to research and document the current regulatory classification of stablecoins.
