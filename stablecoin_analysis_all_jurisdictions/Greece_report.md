# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T23:35:27.431536

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits a complete absence of documented policies addressing stablecoin regulatory requirements in Greece/EU. Based on the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation that will govern stablecoins in the EU, including Greece, all critical regulatory areas are currently non-compliant. The company faces significant regulatory risk and cannot legally operate stablecoin services in Greece without addressing these fundamental gaps. Immediate action is required to develop comprehensive policies and procedures before considering market entry. The most critical gaps relate to licensing authorization, reserve management, and AML/CTF compliance, which would likely prevent regulatory approval if not addressed.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Registration/Licensing for stablecoin issuance or provision of related services in Greece (based on EU-wide MiCA framework expected to apply)

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing the need for regulatory authorization to issue stablecoins or provide related services in the Greek/EU market. No process exists for obtaining necessary licenses from the Hellenic Capital Market Commission or other relevant authorities.

**Impact:** Operating without required authorization could result in enforcement actions, fines, business suspension, reputational damage, and inability to legally offer services in Greece/EU.

**Recommendation:** 1. Immediately establish a regulatory licensing strategy team. 2. Develop a comprehensive licensing application process document. 3. Create a regulatory engagement protocol for communications with Greek/EU authorities. 4. Implement a regulatory monitoring system for MiCA implementation timelines.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Reserve management and backing requirements for asset-referenced tokens (stablecoins) under MiCA

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** No policies exist regarding reserve composition, custody, segregation, valuation, or audit requirements for stablecoin backing assets. No procedures for maintaining adequate liquidity or ensuring 1:1 backing.

**Impact:** Failure to maintain proper reserves could lead to stablecoin depegging, loss of consumer confidence, regulatory sanctions, and potential insolvency issues.

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop a comprehensive reserve management policy specifying eligible assets, custody arrangements, and segregation requirements. 2. Implement daily reserve valuation and reporting procedures. 3. Establish independent audit protocols. 4. Create liquidity management and stress testing frameworks.

### Gap 3: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance for stablecoin transactions

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** No specific AML/CTF policies addressing stablecoin transactions, despite Greece's implementation of EU AML directives. No procedures for customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, or suspicious activity reporting specific to stablecoin operations.

**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, potential criminal liability, loss of banking relationships, and inclusion in regulatory blacklists.

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop stablecoin-specific AML/CTF policy incorporating Travel Rule requirements. 2. Implement blockchain analytics tools for transaction monitoring. 3. Create customer risk assessment framework for stablecoin users. 4. Establish reporting protocols to Greek Financial Intelligence Unit.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements including whitepaper approval and ongoing transparency

**Recommendation:** 1. Create a disclosure policy compliant with MiCA Article 19 requirements. 2. Develop whitepaper creation and approval workflow. 3. Implement ongoing disclosure procedures for material changes. 4. Establish complaint handling and redress mechanisms.

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Governance and risk management framework requirements under MiCA

**Recommendation:** 1. Establish a comprehensive governance framework document. 2. Develop risk management policy covering market, liquidity, operational, and custody risks. 3. Implement internal control procedures. 4. Create business continuity and incident response plans.

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Capital requirements and own funds obligations for stablecoin issuers

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop capital management policy aligned with MiCA Article 34. 2. Establish capital monitoring and reporting procedures. 3. Create capital planning and stress testing framework. 4. Document capital allocation and maintenance protocols.
