# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-12T17:11:59.359080

## Executive Summary
The company currently has no documented policies addressing stablecoin regulatory requirements for Saint Martin. This represents a critical compliance failure with immediate regulatory risk. All fundamental regulatory requirements are unmet, creating significant exposure to enforcement actions, business suspension, and reputational damage. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive regulatory compliance program, beginning with licensing requirements and reserve management policies. The company should consider suspending any stablecoin operations until basic compliance frameworks are established and approved by regulatory authorities.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance requires licensing/registration with financial authorities in Saint Martin (likely under Central Bank of Curaçao and Sint Maarten jurisdiction)

**Current Status:** No documented policy for stablecoin issuance or regulatory registration

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing licensing requirements for stablecoin operations in Saint Martin

**Impact:** Potential for regulatory enforcement actions, fines, business suspension, and reputational damage

**Recommendation:** Immediately research and document specific licensing requirements from Central Bank of Curaçao and Sint Maarten. Develop a licensing application policy and timeline.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Stablecoin reserves must be fully backed and subject to regular independent audits

**Current Status:** No reserve management or audit policies documented

**Gap:** Missing policies for reserve composition, custody, verification, and third-party audit requirements

**Impact:** Risk of regulatory sanctions for operating unbacked stablecoins, loss of user trust, potential insolvency

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive reserve management policy specifying: 1) Acceptable reserve assets, 2) Custody arrangements, 3) Daily reserve verification procedures, 4) Quarterly independent audit requirements

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and reporting suspicious activities

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT policies specific to stablecoin operations

**Gap:** Lack of tailored AML/CFT framework for stablecoin transactions, customer verification, and monitoring

**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties, potential criminal liability, loss of banking relationships

**Recommendation:** Create stablecoin-specific AML/CFT policy incorporating: 1) KYC procedures for wallet holders, 2) Transaction monitoring thresholds, 3) Suspicious activity reporting protocols, 4) Record-keeping requirements

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including disclosure requirements, redemption rights, and risk warnings

**Recommendation:** Develop consumer protection policy covering: 1) Clear disclosure of stablecoin mechanics and risks, 2) Transparent redemption procedures, 3) Complaint handling process, 4) User fund protection measures

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity requirements for digital asset platforms

**Recommendation:** Establish operational resilience framework including: 1) Cybersecurity standards, 2) Incident response plan, 3) Business continuity procedures, 4) Regular penetration testing requirements
