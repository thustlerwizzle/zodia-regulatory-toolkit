No documented policies exist for licensing, reserve management, consumer protection, AML/CFT, operational resilience, governance, or reporting. This represents a critical compliance failure that requires immediate attention. The company must prioritize licensing application and AML/CFT compliance while developing a comprehensive policy framework. Engagement with the GFSC and legal counsel specializing in Guernsey digital asset regulation is urgently recommended.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Guernsey Financial Services Commission (GFSC) requires stablecoin issuers to obtain a license under the Digital Asset Issuance and Custody Rules 2024\n\n**Current Status:** No documented licensing policy or application process\n\n**Gap:** Company lacks policies for obtaining required GFSC licensing for stablecoin issuance\n\n**Impact:** Operating without proper license could result in enforcement actions, fines, and business shutdown\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop licensing application policy and engage with GFSC to initiate licensing process\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** GFSC requires 100% reserve backing for stablecoins with regular independent audits\n\n**Current Status:** No reserve management or audit policies documented\n\n**Gap:** Missing policies for reserve composition, custody, and independent verification\n\n**Impact:** Non-compliance could lead to loss of consumer confidence, regulatory sanctions, and potential insolvency\n\n**Recommendation:** Create reserve management policy specifying asset types, custody arrangements, and quarterly independent audit requirements\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance under Guernsey's AML/CFT framework\n\n**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT policies\n\n**Gap:** Missing customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting procedures\n\n**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties, loss of banking relationships, and criminal liability\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive AML/CFT program including KYC procedures, transaction monitoring, and SAR reporting\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection requirements including clear disclosures, redemption rights, and risk warnings\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive consumer protection policy including disclosure templates and redemption procedures\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity requirements for digital asset issuers\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop operational resilience framework including business continuity plans and cybersecurity protocols\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-006\n**Requirement:** Governance requirements including board oversight, risk management, and compliance functions\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish governance framework with clear board responsibilities, risk committee, and independent compliance function\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌
