Policy Title\n**Eritrea-Specific Digital Asset Operational Risk Management and Cybersecurity Policy**\n\n## 2. Purpose and Scope\n\n### 2.1 Purpose\nThe purpose of this policy is to establish a comprehensive operational risk management and cybersecurity framework for all digital asset activities conducted by [Organization Name] within the State of Eritrea. This policy is designed to address the unique technological, infrastructural, and regulatory environment of Eritrea, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of digital asset systems and data, while maintaining operational resilience.\n\n### 2.2 Scope\nThis policy applies to:\n*   All employees, contractors, consultants, and third-party service providers of [Organization Name] involved in the management, trading, custody, or transaction of digital assets.\n*   All information systems, networks, hardware, software, and data associated with digital asset operations, whether hosted on-premises within Eritrea or accessed via approved external services.\n*   All operational processes supporting digital asset activities, including but not limited to key management, transaction authorization, wallet custody, and node operation.\n*   This policy is effective immediately upon approval and governs all digital asset operations within the jurisdiction of Eritrea.\n\n## 3. Definitions\n\n*   **Digital Assets:** Cryptographically secured digital representations of value or contractual rights that use distributed ledger technology (DLT) or similar technology (e.g., cryptocurrencies, tokenized assets).\n*   **Operational Risk:** The risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems, or from external events, specific to the digital asset ecosystem.\n*   **Cybersecurity:** The practice of protecting systems, networks, programs, and data from digital attack, damage, or unauthorized access.\n*   **Business Continuity Plan (BCP):** A documented strategy outlining how an organization will continue operating during and after a disruptive incident.\n*   **Eritrea-Specific Challenges:** Recognized environmental factors including, but not limited to, intermittent electrical power supply, limited terrestrial broadband internet redundancy, geographic isolation of certain infrastructure, and specific national regulatory directives.\n*   **Private Key:** A secret cryptographic key used to sign transactions and prove ownership of a digital asset.\n*   **Cold Storage:** The practice of keeping digital asset private keys completely offline.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\n\n[Organization Name] is committed to the secure and resilient operation of its digital asset activities in Eritrea. This policy mandates the implementation of an operational risk framework and cybersecurity controls tailored to the local environment. All personnel are required to adhere to the procedures outlined herein to protect organizational assets, ensure regulatory compliance, and sustain critical business functions in the face of disruptions.\n\n## 5. Procedures\n\n### 5.1 Eritrea-Specific Operational Risk Framework\n1.  **Risk Identification & Assessment:** A quarterly risk assessment must be conducted, explicitly considering Eritrean infrastructure limitations (e.g., power stability, connectivity), local threat landscapes, and national legal requirements.\n2.  **Key Management:** All digital asset private keys must be managed under a strict hierarchy. A minimum of 95% of custodial assets must be held in **cold storage** solutions, with private keys stored in geographically separate, secure facilities within Eritrea to mitigate single-point connectivity failures.\n3.  **Infrastructure Redundancy:** All critical systems (e.g., validation nodes, transaction broadcast systems) must have redundant, independent power supplies (e.g., UPS, on-site generators) and at least two independent internet service providers (ISPs) where available. In regions with limited ISP options, contingency plans using secure satellite-based connectivity must be evaluated and documented.\n4.  **Transaction Verification:** All transactions require multi-signature authorization, with signatories located in different physical facilities to prevent coercion and single-location disruptions.\n\n### 5.2 Localized Cybersecurity Measures\n1.  **Network Security:** All digital asset-related networks must be segmented from the general corporate network. Firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) must be configured and monitored 24/7 from a Security Operations Center (SOC).\n2.  **Endpoint Security:** Any device used to access digital asset systems must have approved anti-malware software, full-disk encryption, and be subject to a strict patch management policy, accounting for potential delays in update availability.\n3.  **Access Control:** Strict principle of least privilege access will be enforced. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is mandatory for all system access, with token-based MFA preferred over SMS-based methods due to potential network unreliability.\n4.  **Physical Security:** Data centers and server rooms housing digital asset infrastructure must comply with enhanced physical security controls, including biometric access logs, 24/7 surveillance, and anti-tamper mechanisms.\n\n### 5.3 Business Continuity Plans (BCP) for Eritrea\n1.  **Disruption Scenarios:** BCPs must specifically address scenarios of prolonged power outage (≥24 hours), nationwide internet service degradation, and political or environmental disruptions affecting physical access to facilities.\n2.  **Recovery Time & Point Objectives (RTO/RPO):** For critical digital asset custody systems, the RTO shall not exceed 6 hours, and the RPO shall be zero (no data loss). These objectives must be tested semi-annually.\n3.  **Alternative Operating Locations:** Designated alternative operating locations (with independent power and connectivity) must be established and capable of assuming full operational control within the defined RTO.\n4.  **Communication Plan:** A redundant communication plan (including satellite phones and pre-arranged meeting points) must be established to coordinate response efforts during widespread telecommunications disruptions.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n\n*   All personnel must complete annual training on this policy and Eritrea-specific digital asset risks.\n*   The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) or designated officer is responsible for ongoing compliance monitoring.\n*   Any breach of this policy, including circumvention of security controls or failure to follow BCP protocols, will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination and legal prosecution.\n*   All third-party vendors providing services related to digital assets must contractually agree to security standards equivalent to those in this policy.\n*   A record of all risk assessments, security incidents, BCP tests, and policy exceptions must be maintained for a minimum of five years.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule\n\nThis policy shall be reviewed and updated:\n*   **Annually,** as part of the standard policy review cycle.\n*   **Immediately,** following any significant security incident affecting the digital asset industry globally or within Eritrea.\n*   **Immediately,** upon changes to Eritrean national laws or regulations pertaining to digital assets, cybersecurity, or critical infrastructure.\n*   All updates require approval from the Board of Directors or its designated Risk Committee.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements\n\nThis policy is designed to align with the overarching principles of operational risk and cybersecurity, while anticipating the development of a formal regulatory framework for digital assets in Eritrea. It is constructed with reference to:\n*   General principles of banking and financial operational risk management.\n*   International standards for cybersecurity, including elements from the ISO/IEC 27001 framework, adapted for the Eritrean context.\n*   Eritrea's national interests in securing critical economic infrastructure and maintaining financial stability.\n*   The policy will be formally amended to reference specific Eritrean digital asset regulations upon their enactment by the relevant governmental authorities (e.g., Ministry of Finance, Bank of Eritrea).\n\n---\n**Policy Approval**\n\nApproved By: _________________________\n[Name, Title of Approving Authority]\n\nSignature: ___________________________\n\nDate: ___/___/____\n\n**Version:** 1.0\n**Effective Date:** [Date of Approval]\n```"

Policy Title\n**Eritrea-Specific Digital Asset Operational Risk Management and Cybersecurity Policy**\n\n## 2. Purpose and Scope\n\n### 2.1 Purpose\nThe purpose of this policy is to establish a comprehensive operational risk management and cybersecurity framework for all digital asset activities conducted by [Organization Name] within the State of Eritrea. This policy is designed to address the unique technological, infrastructural, and regulatory environment of Eritrea, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of digital asset systems and data, while maintaining operational resilience.\n\n### 2.2 Scope\nThis policy applies to:\n*   All employees, contractors, consultants, and third-party service providers of [Organization Name] involved in the management, trading, custody, or transaction of digital assets.\n*   All information systems, networks, hardware, software, and data associated with digital asset operations, whether hosted on-premises within Eritrea or accessed via approved external services.\n*   All operational processes supporting digital asset activities, including but not limited to key management, transaction authorization, wallet custody, and node operation.\n*   This policy is effective immediately upon approval and governs all digital asset operations within the jurisdiction of Eritrea.\n\n## 3. Definitions\n\n*   **Digital Assets:** Cryptographically secured digital representations of value or contractual rights that use distributed ledger technology (DLT) or similar technology (e.g., cryptocurrencies, tokenized assets).\n*   **Operational Risk:** The risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems, or from external events, specific to the digital asset ecosystem.\n*   **Cybersecurity:** The practice of protecting systems, networks, programs, and data from digital attack, damage, or unauthorized access.\n*   **Business Continuity Plan (BCP):** A documented strategy outlining how an organization will continue operating during and after a disruptive incident.\n*   **Eritrea-Specific Challenges:** Recognized environmental factors including, but not limited to, intermittent electrical power supply, limited terrestrial broadband internet redundancy, geographic isolation of certain infrastructure, and specific national regulatory directives.\n*   **Private Key:** A secret cryptographic key used to sign transactions and prove ownership of a digital asset.\n*   **Cold Storage:** The practice of keeping digital asset private keys completely offline.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\n\n[Organization Name] is committed to the secure and resilient operation of its digital asset activities in Eritrea. This policy mandates the implementation of an operational risk framework and cybersecurity controls tailored to the local environment. All personnel are required to adhere to the procedures outlined herein to protect organizational assets, ensure regulatory compliance, and sustain critical business functions in the face of disruptions.\n\n## 5. Procedures\n\n### 5.1 Eritrea-Specific Operational Risk Framework\n1.  **Risk Identification & Assessment:** A quarterly risk assessment must be conducted, explicitly considering Eritrean infrastructure limitations (e.g., power stability, connectivity), local threat landscapes, and national legal requirements.\n2.  **Key Management:** All digital asset private keys must be managed under a strict hierarchy. A minimum of 95% of custodial assets must be held in **cold storage** solutions, with private keys stored in geographically separate, secure facilities within Eritrea to mitigate single-point connectivity failures.\n3.  **Infrastructure Redundancy:** All critical systems (e.g., validation nodes, transaction broadcast systems) must have redundant, independent power supplies (e.g., UPS, on-site generators) and at least two independent internet service providers (ISPs) where available. In regions with limited ISP options, contingency plans using secure satellite-based connectivity must be evaluated and documented.\n4.  **Transaction Verification:** All transactions require multi-signature authorization, with signatories located in different physical facilities to prevent coercion and single-location disruptions.\n\n### 5.2 Localized Cybersecurity Measures\n1.  **Network Security:** All digital asset-related networks must be segmented from the general corporate network.

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is mandatory for all system access, with token-based MFA preferred over SMS-based methods due to potential network unreliability.\n4.  **Physical Security:** Data centers and server rooms housing digital asset infrastructure must comply with enhanced physical security controls, including biometric access logs, 24/7 surveillance, and anti-tamper mechanisms.\n\n### 5.3 Business Continuity Plans (BCP) for Eritrea\n1.  **Disruption Scenarios:** BCPs must specifically address scenarios of prolonged power outage (≥24 hours), nationwide internet service degradation, and political or environmental disruptions affecting physical access to facilities.\n2.  **Recovery Time & Point Objectives (RTO/RPO):** For critical digital asset custody systems, the RTO shall not exceed 6 hours, and the RPO shall be zero (no data loss). These objectives must be tested semi-annually.\n3.  **Alternative Operating Locations:** Designated alternative operating locations (with independent power and connectivity) must be established and capable of assuming full operational control within the defined RTO.\n4.  **Communication Plan:** A redundant communication plan (including satellite phones and pre-arranged meeting points) must be established to coordinate response efforts during widespread telecommunications disruptions.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n\n*   All personnel must complete annual training on this policy and Eritrea-specific digital asset risks.\n*   The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) or designated officer is responsible for ongoing compliance monitoring.\n*   Any breach of this policy, including circumvention of security controls or failure to follow BCP protocols, will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination and legal prosecution.\n*   All third-party vendors providing services related to digital assets must contractually agree to security standards equivalent to those in this policy.\n*   A record of all risk assessments, security incidents, BCP tests, and policy exceptions must be maintained for a minimum of five years.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule\n\nThis policy shall be reviewed and updated:\n*   **Annually,** as part of the standard policy review cycle.\n*   **Immediately,** following any significant security incident affecting the digital asset industry globally or within Eritrea.\n*   **Immediately,** upon changes to Eritrean national laws or regulations pertaining to digital assets, cybersecurity, or critical infrastructure.\n*   All updates require approval from the Board of Directors or its designated Risk Committee.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements\n\nThis policy is designed to align with the overarching principles of operational risk and cybersecurity, while anticipating the development of a formal regulatory framework for digital assets in Eritrea. It is constructed with reference to:\n*   General principles of banking and financial operational risk management.\n*   International standards for cybersecurity, including elements from the ISO/IEC 27001 framework, adapted for the Eritrean context.\n*   Eritrea's national interests in securing critical economic infrastructure and maintaining financial stability.\n*   The policy will be formally amended to reference specific Eritrean digital asset regulations upon their enactment by the relevant governmental authorities (e.g., Ministry of Finance, Bank of Eritrea).\n\n---\n**Policy Approval**\n\nApproved By: _________________________\n[Name, Title of Approving Authority]\n\nSignature: ___________________________\n\nDate: ___/___/____\n\n**Version:** 1.0\n**Effective Date:** [Date of Approval]\n```"
