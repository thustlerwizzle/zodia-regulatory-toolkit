Purpose and Scope\n**Purpose:**  \nThis policy establishes a comprehensive framework to ensure that all issued stablecoins are fully backed 1:1 by High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) held in segregated custody. It mandates regular independent verification and public transparency to maintain trust, ensure regulatory compliance, and promote financial stability.\n\n**Scope:**  \nThis policy applies to all activities related to the issuance, reserve management, and auditing of [Company Name]’s stablecoin(s). It is binding for all relevant departments, including Treasury, Finance, Legal, Compliance, and Risk Management, as well as any engaged third-party custodians and auditors.\n\n## 3. Definitions\n*   **Stablecoin:** A digital asset issued by [Company Name] designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified fiat currency (e.g., USD).\n*   **High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA):** Assets that can be easily and immediately converted into cash at little or no loss of value. As defined in this policy, this includes:\n    *   Cash and cash equivalents (e.g., central bank reserves, demand deposits).\n    *   Short-term government securities (e.g., U.S. Treasury Bills with less than 3 months to maturity).\n    *   Other instruments pre-approved by the Compliance and Risk Committee that meet equivalent safety and liquidity standards.\n*   **Qualified Custodian:** A regulated financial institution (e.g., a bank or trust company) that provides secure asset custody services, meeting the regulatory and operational standards defined in Section 5.1.\n*   **Segregated Custody:** A custody arrangement where client assets (reserve assets) are held separately from the custodian’s own assets and are not available to the custodian’s creditors.\n*   **Attestation:** A monthly report issued by management confirming the 1:1 reserve backing as of a specific date.\n*   **Independent Audit:** A formal examination and opinion on the reserve holdings and management controls performed quarterly by an independent, certified public accounting firm.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\n[Company Name] is committed to maintaining full 1:1 backing for all outstanding stablecoins with HQLA held in segregated custody accounts. We will ensure transparency through regular independent audits and public disclosure. Compliance with this policy is mandatory to satisfy regulatory obligations and uphold the highest standards of consumer protection and market integrity.\n\n## 5. Procedures\n\n### 5.1. Reserve Custody & Safekeeping\n1.  All reserve assets must be held in **segregated accounts** with one or more **Qualified Custodians**.\n2.  The selection of a Qualified Custodian requires due diligence and formal approval by the Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer (CFO). Criteria include:\n    *   Relevant regulatory licenses and a clean regulatory history.\n    *   Demonstrated financial stability and operational excellence.\n    *   Robust technological security and insurance coverage.\n3.  [Company Name] retains clear legal title to all reserve assets. Custody agreements must explicitly prohibit the custodian from re-hypothecating, pledging, or otherwise encumbering the reserve assets.\n\n### 5.2. Reserve Composition & Management\n1.  The Treasury Department is responsible for managing the reserve portfolio to ensure it consists solely of pre-approved HQLA.\n2.  The portfolio must be managed to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet potential redemption demands under both normal and stressed conditions.\n3.  Any deviation from the defined HQLA list requires prior written approval from the Risk and Compliance Committee.\n\n### 5.3. Monthly Attestations\n1.  By the **5th business day** following the end of each calendar month, the CFO will prepare and sign a Management Attestation Report.\n2.  This report will attest that, as of the last day of the month, the fair value of the HQLA reserves was at least equal to the total face value of stablecoins in circulation.\n3.  The report will be filed with the Compliance Officer and made publicly available on the company website.\n\n### 5.4. Quarterly Independent Audits\n1.  An independent, PCAOB-registered (or equivalent) accounting firm will be engaged to perform a quarterly audit of the reserve holdings.\n2.  The audit will verify the existence, ownership, and valuation of the HQLA as of the quarter-end date.\n3.  The auditor will issue a formal opinion report within **45 days** of each quarter-end. This report will be published on the company website.\n\n### 5.5. Public Disclosure\n1.  The following information will be published and updated monthly on the company’s official website:\n    *   The total face value of stablecoins in circulation.\n    *   The total fair value of reserve assets.\n    *   A detailed breakdown of the reserve composition by asset category (e.g., % cash, % treasury bills).\n    *   The identity of the primary Qualified Custodian(s).\n    *   The most recent Monthly Attestation and Quarterly Audit Report.\n\n### 5.6. Liquidity Stress Testing\n1.  The Risk Management Department will conduct liquidity stress tests at least **semi-annually**.\n2.  Scenarios will model extreme but plausible redemption pressures (e.g., market-wide shock, loss of confidence).\n3.  The stress test report, reviewed by the Risk and Compliance Committee, will assess the adequacy of HQLA to meet liabilities under stress and inform contingency funding plans.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n*   The Compliance Officer is responsible for monitoring adherence to this policy.\n*   Failure to comply may result in disciplinary action, regulatory reporting obligations, and operational remediation.\n*   All employees must report any suspected violations to the Compliance Officer immediately.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule\nThis policy shall be reviewed annually by the Legal and Compliance Department in conjunction with the Risk Management and Treasury Departments. It will be updated as necessary to reflect changes in regulatory requirements, industry standards, or company operations. The most recent version will be distributed to all relevant personnel.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements\nThis policy is designed to comply with and implement the core regulatory requirement that \"Stablecoin issuers must maintain 1:1 reserves in high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) with regular independent audits.\" It anticipates and aligns with evolving global regulatory frameworks, including proposed rules from:\n*   The U.S. President’s Working Group on Financial Markets (PWG) Report on Stablecoins.\n*   Guidance from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC).\n*   International standards as discussed by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS).\n\n---\n**Policy Version:** 1.0  \n**Effective Date:** [Date]  \n**Approved By:** [Name of CEO/Board Chair]  \n**Last Reviewed:** [Date]\n```"

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Azores\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-02-12T17:35:40.776376\n\n## Executive Summary\nCRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no documented policies addressing stablecoin regulatory requirements. This represents a complete compliance failure across all major regulatory domains. Immediate action is required to develop comprehensive policies and obtain necessary licenses before any stablecoin operations can commence. The company is currently non-compliant with EU/Portuguese financial regulations and would face immediate enforcement action if operating. Priority must be given to licensing, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance as these represent existential risks to the business.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must maintain 1:1 reserves in high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) with regular independent audits\n\n**Current Status:** No documented reserve management or audit policy\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of reserve management framework, custody arrangements, or audit procedures required for stablecoin issuance\n\n**Impact:** Regulatory enforcement actions, license revocation, criminal liability for misrepresentation, loss of customer trust, potential insolvency\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive reserve management policy including: 1) Segregated custody arrangements with qualified custodians 2) Monthly attestations and quarterly independent audits 3) Public disclosure of reserve composition 4) Liquidity stress testing procedures\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance including KYC, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting\n\n**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT program\n\n**Gap:** Missing entire AML/CFT framework required for financial services involving stablecoins\n\n**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, criminal prosecution, inability to access banking services, reputational damage\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive AML/CFT program including: 1) Risk-based customer due diligence 2) Transaction monitoring system 3) Suspicious activity reporting procedures 4) Designated compliance officer 5) Regular employee training\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Licensing and registration requirements for stablecoin issuance and related financial services\n\n**Current Status:** No documented licensing strategy or regulatory engagement plan\n\n**Gap:** Unclear regulatory status and missing licensing applications for stablecoin operations\n\n**Impact:** Operating without required licenses, immediate regulatory shutdown, criminal charges for unlicensed financial services\n\n**Recommendation:** Conduct jurisdictional analysis and apply for necessary licenses before operations begin. Engage legal counsel to determine specific Azores/Portuguese/EU licensing requirements\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop consumer protection framework including: 1) Clear redemption policy with timelines 2) Comprehensive risk disclosures 3) Complaint handling procedures 4) Data protection and privacy measures\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Operational risk management including cybersecurity, business continuity, and third-party risk management\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish operational risk management program including: 1) Cybersecurity framework (NIST/ISO) 2) Business continuity and disaster recovery plans 3) Third-party vendor risk management 4) Incident response procedures\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **reserve_requirements**: not_met\n❌ **aml_cft_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **consumer_protection**: not_met\n❌ **operational_risk_management**: not_met\n❌ **licensing_registration**: not_met\n❌ **governance_oversight**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update Summary\nGenerated: 2026-02-12T17:36:18.670827\n\n## Overview\nThis document summarizes proposed updates to company policies and standards based on regulatory gap analysis.\n\n## New Policies Required\n\n## Modified Policies\n\n### GAP-001\n**Category:** Compliance\n**Current Policy:** No documented reserve management or audit policy\n**Proposed Change:** Develop comprehensive reserve management policy including: 1) Segregated custody arrangements with qualified custodians 2) Monthly attestations and quarterly independent audits 3) Public disclosure of reserve composition 4) Liquidity stress testing procedures\n\n### GAP-002\n**Category:** AML/KYC\n**Current Policy:** No documented AML/CFT program\n**Proposed Change:** Implement comprehensive AML/CFT program including: 1) Risk-based customer due diligence 2) Transaction monitoring system 3) Suspicious activity reporting procedures 4) Designated compliance officer 5) Regular employee training\n\n### GAP-003\n**Category:** Data Protection\n**Current Policy:** No consumer protection policies documented\n**Proposed Change:** Develop consumer protection framework including: 1) Clear redemption policy with timelines 2) Comprehensive risk disclosures 3) Complaint handling procedures 4) Data protection and privacy measures\n\n### GAP-004\n**Category:** Risk Management\n**Current Policy:** No documented operational risk management framework\n**Proposed Change:** Establish operational risk management program including: 1) Cybersecurity framework (NIST/ISO) 2) Business continuity and disaster recovery plans 3) Third-party vendor risk management 4) Incident response procedures\n\n### GAP-005\n**Category:** Compliance\n**Current Policy:** No documented licensing strategy or regulatory engagement plan\n**Proposed Change:** Conduct jurisdictional analysis and apply for necessary licenses before operations begin.
