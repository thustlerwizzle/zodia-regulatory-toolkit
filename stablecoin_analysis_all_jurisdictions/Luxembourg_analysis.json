This represents a complete regulatory gap that prevents any lawful stablecoin operations in Luxembourg. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive compliance program before considering any market entry or operations. The most critical gaps relate to authorization requirements, reserve management, and redemption rights under MiCA and CSSF regulations. The company should prioritize engaging legal counsel specializing in Luxembourg financial regulation and developing foundational policies before any operational activities."

Purpose and Scope\n### 2.1 Purpose\nThis policy establishes a comprehensive framework for the management, custody, and segregation of reserve assets held against issued electronic money tokens (EMTs) and asset-referenced tokens (ARTs), in full compliance with the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) Articles 31-36. The policy aims to ensure the protection of token holders, maintain sufficient liquidity, and mitigate operational, credit, and custody risks associated with reserve assets.\n\n### 2.2 Scope\nThis policy applies to all business units, personnel, and third-party service providers involved in the issuance of EMTs or ARTs, and the management of the corresponding reserve assets. It covers the entire lifecycle of reserve assets, including their selection, valuation, custody, segregation, reconciliation, and audit.\n\n## 3. Definitions\n*   **Asset-Referenced Token (ART):** As defined under MiCA Article 3(1)(3).\n*   **Electronic Money Token (EMT):** As defined under MiCA Article 3(1)(4).\n*   **Reserve Assets:** The pool of high-quality, liquid assets held in full backing of the claims of token holders, as required by MiCA.\n*   **Custodian:** A regulated entity (credit institution, crypto-asset service provider authorized for custody, or other authorized financial institution) entrusted with the safekeeping of reserve assets.\n*   **Segregation:** The legal and operational separation of reserve assets from the issuer's own assets and from assets held for other clients of a custodian.\n*   **Independent Auditor:** A statutory auditor or audit firm, registered and supervised in accordance with EU law, responsible for the external attestation of reserve management.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\n[Company Name] is committed to maintaining at all times a reserve of assets that fully backs the value of its issued tokens. These assets shall be managed prudently, held in secure custody under strict segregation, and subject to regular independent audit to ensure the highest level of protection for token holders and compliance with all applicable regulations, primarily MiCA.\n\n## 5. Procedures\n\n### 5.1 Eligible Reserve Assets\n1.  **Composition:** Reserve assets shall be limited to the following high-quality, liquid financial instruments as permitted under MiCA:\n    *   Cash deposits held in credit institutions.\n    *   High-quality sovereign bonds (e.g., EU Member State, EEA, or OECD government bonds with high credit ratings).\n    *   High-quality corporate bonds.\n    *   Money market instruments.\n    *   Other assets deemed sufficiently low-risk and liquid as specified in regulatory technical standards.\n2.  **Prohibition:** Crypto-assets shall not be included in the reserve.\n3.  **Concentration Limits:** Holdings of any single issuer, counterparty, or instrument type shall not exceed limits set to mitigate concentration risk, in line with MiCA Article 35.\n4.  **Valuation:** All reserve assets shall be valued daily at their market value or, where no reliable market price exists, a prudent and conservative valuation methodology approved by the Risk Committee.\n\n### 5.2 Custody Arrangements\n1.  **Custodian Selection:** Reserve assets must be placed with one or more independent, regulated custodians. Due diligence must be performed on all custodians prior to engagement and reviewed annually, assessing their:\n    *   Regulatory authorization and standing.\n    *   Financial soundness.\n    *   Operational security and controls (including cybersecurity).\n    *   Insurance coverage.\n    *   Geographic risk.\n2.  **Custody Agreement:** A written agreement must be in place with each custodian, explicitly mandating the segregation of [Company Name]'s reserve assets and outlining the custodian's liability.\n\n### 5.3 Segregation Requirements\n1.  **Legal Segregation:** Reserve assets must be legally segregated from the assets of [Company Name] and held in separate accounts designated for the exclusive purpose of backing token holder claims. They must also be segregated from the custodian's own assets and the assets of the custodian's other clients.\n2.  **Operational Segregation:** Internal systems and accounts must clearly identify and track reserve assets separately from all other corporate assets. Access controls must ensure only authorized personnel can initiate transactions related to the reserve.\n3.  **Ring-Fencing:** In the event of insolvency of [Company Name] or a custodian, the reserve assets must be fully protected and readily identifiable for the benefit of token holders.\n\n### 5.4 Management and Operations\n1.  **Responsibility:** The Treasury Department, under the oversight of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and the Risk Management function, is responsible for the day-to-day management of the reserve portfolio.\n2.  **Investment Mandate:** The reserve shall be managed with the primary objectives of **safety, liquidity, and stability**. Yield generation is a secondary consideration.

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Luxembourg\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-02-06T00:23:00.247408\n\n## Executive Summary\nCRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no documented policies addressing Luxembourg's stablecoin regulatory framework. This represents a complete regulatory gap that prevents any lawful stablecoin operations in Luxembourg. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive compliance program before considering any market entry or operations. The most critical gaps relate to authorization requirements, reserve management, and redemption rights under MiCA and CSSF regulations. The company should prioritize engaging legal counsel specializing in Luxembourg financial regulation and developing foundational policies before any operational activities.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Authorization requirement for issuing stablecoins (CSSF Circular 22/806 and upcoming MiCA framework)\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing authorization requirements for stablecoin issuance or service provision in Luxembourg\n\n**Impact:** Legal prohibition from operating, potential enforcement actions, fines, and reputational damage\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive authorization policy outlining application requirements, capital requirements, governance standards, and risk management frameworks required by CSSF\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Reserve asset management and segregation requirements (MiCA Article 31-36)\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found\n\n**Gap:** No policies governing reserve composition, custody, segregation, or audit requirements for stablecoin reserves\n\n**Impact:** Inability to demonstrate asset-backed stability, potential consumer harm, regulatory sanctions, and loss of market confidence\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish reserve management policy specifying eligible assets, custody arrangements, segregation requirements, and independent audit procedures\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Redemption rights and procedures (MiCA Article 47)\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found\n\n**Gap:** No policies ensuring holders' right to redeem stablecoins at par value under normal and stressed conditions\n\n**Impact:** Violation of consumer protection requirements, potential legal liability, and loss of user trust\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement redemption policy with clear procedures, timelines, fees (if any), and stress scenario protocols\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Governance and risk management frameworks (CSSF Circular 22/806)\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop governance framework with clear roles/responsibilities, risk appetite statement, three lines of defense model, and regular board reporting\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance (Luxembourg AML Law and CSSF requirements)\n\n**Recommendation:** Create stablecoin-specific AML/CFT policy addressing wallet screening, transaction monitoring, KYC/CDD procedures, and suspicious activity reporting\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-007\n**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity (CSSF requirements and DORA)\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement operational resilience framework with cybersecurity controls, BCP/DR plans, incident response procedures, and third-party risk management\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **authorization_requirements**: not_met\n❌ **reserve_management**: not_met\n❌ **redemption_rights**:
