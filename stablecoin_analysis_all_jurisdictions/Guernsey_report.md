# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-11T20:57:29.062356

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits significant compliance gaps across all major regulatory requirements for stablecoin issuance in Guernsey. No documented policies exist for licensing, reserve management, consumer protection, AML/CFT, operational resilience, governance, or reporting. This represents a critical compliance failure that requires immediate attention. The company must prioritize licensing application and AML/CFT compliance while developing a comprehensive policy framework. Engagement with the GFSC and legal counsel specializing in Guernsey digital asset regulation is urgently recommended.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Guernsey Financial Services Commission (GFSC) requires stablecoin issuers to obtain a license under the Digital Asset Issuance and Custody Rules 2024

**Current Status:** No documented licensing policy or application process

**Gap:** Company lacks policies for obtaining required GFSC licensing for stablecoin issuance

**Impact:** Operating without proper license could result in enforcement actions, fines, and business shutdown

**Recommendation:** Develop licensing application policy and engage with GFSC to initiate licensing process

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** GFSC requires 100% reserve backing for stablecoins with regular independent audits

**Current Status:** No reserve management or audit policies documented

**Gap:** Missing policies for reserve composition, custody, and independent verification

**Impact:** Non-compliance could lead to loss of consumer confidence, regulatory sanctions, and potential insolvency

**Recommendation:** Create reserve management policy specifying asset types, custody arrangements, and quarterly independent audit requirements

### Gap 3: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance under Guernsey's AML/CFT framework

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT policies

**Gap:** Missing customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting procedures

**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties, loss of banking relationships, and criminal liability

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive AML/CFT program including KYC procedures, transaction monitoring, and SAR reporting

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Consumer protection requirements including clear disclosures, redemption rights, and risk warnings

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive consumer protection policy including disclosure templates and redemption procedures

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity requirements for digital asset issuers

**Recommendation:** Develop operational resilience framework including business continuity plans and cybersecurity protocols

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Governance requirements including board oversight, risk management, and compliance functions

**Recommendation:** Establish governance framework with clear board responsibilities, risk committee, and independent compliance function
