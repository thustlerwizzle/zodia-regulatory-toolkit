# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T20:23:04.560267

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits a complete lack of policies addressing stablecoin regulation in the Central African Republic. All identified regulatory requirements are currently not met, representing critical compliance gaps. The absence of any documented policies creates significant legal, operational, and reputational risks. Immediate action is required to conduct proper regulatory research and develop comprehensive policies before considering operations in the CAR jurisdiction. The highest priority should be given to establishing the legal framework, licensing compliance, and AML/CFT requirements, as these represent the most immediate regulatory risks.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Legal framework for stablecoin issuance and operation in Central African Republic (CAR)

**Current Status:** No documented policies for CAR stablecoin operations

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing CAR's specific regulatory environment for stablecoins

**Impact:** Legal exposure, potential regulatory sanctions, inability to operate legally in CAR jurisdiction

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Licensing requirements for digital asset service providers in CAR

**Current Status:** No licensing framework documentation or procedures

**Gap:** Missing policies for obtaining and maintaining required licenses in CAR

**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance for stablecoin transactions in CAR

**Recommendation:** Develop CAR-specific AML/CFT policies aligned with local regulations and FATF recommendations

**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements

**Recommendation:** Create comprehensive consumer protection framework including clear disclosures, terms of service, and complaint handling procedures

### Gap 3: GAP-005
