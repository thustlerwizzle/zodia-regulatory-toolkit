# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T21:33:10.372776

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no documented policies addressing stablecoin regulation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. All fundamental regulatory requirements appear unmet, creating severe legal, operational, and reputational risks. Immediate action is required to: 1) Conduct comprehensive regulatory research on DRC's specific requirements, 2) Develop a complete policy framework addressing licensing, AML/CTF, consumer protection, and reserve management, and 3) Establish governance structures for ongoing regulatory compliance. The company should not conduct stablecoin operations in DRC until these critical gaps are addressed and proper authorization is obtained.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Legal authorization/licensing for stablecoin issuance or operations in DRC

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing the fundamental requirement for legal authorization to operate stablecoin-related services in the Democratic Republic of the Congo

**Impact:** Potential for immediate regulatory enforcement actions, fines, license revocation, or criminal liability for operating without proper authorization

**Recommendation:** 1. Conduct comprehensive regulatory research on DRC's financial regulations 2. Establish licensing application procedures 3. Create policy framework for regulatory engagement with DRC authorities

### Gap 2: GAP-002

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements

**Recommendation:** 1. Create consumer protection policy with clear disclosures 2. Establish complaint resolution procedures 3. Implement risk communication framework 4. Develop terms of service compliant with local consumer protection laws

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Reserve management and transparency for stablecoin issuers

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop reserve management policy with asset composition rules 2. Establish independent custody arrangements 3. Implement regular audit procedures 4. Create public disclosure framework for reserve status

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop comprehensive operational risk management framework 2. Implement cybersecurity standards (ISO 27001 equivalent) 3. Establish incident response plan 4. Create business continuity and disaster recovery procedures
