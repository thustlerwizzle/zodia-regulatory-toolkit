Purpose and Scope\n### Purpose\nThis policy establishes comprehensive requirements for the management, custody, and verification of reserves backing issued stablecoins to ensure full 1:1 backing by High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA), protect customer funds, and comply with all applicable regulatory standards.\n\n### Scope\nThis policy applies to all issued stablecoin liabilities, the associated reserve assets, and all personnel, departments, and third-party service providers (including custodians and auditors) involved in the reserve management process.\n\n## 3. Definitions\n*   **Stablecoin:** A digital asset issued by the Company designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified fiat currency (e.g., USD).\n*   **Reserve Assets:** The collective pool of assets held to back the total outstanding stablecoin liabilities.\n*   **High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA):** Assets that are low-risk, readily marketable, and convertible to cash with minimal loss of value, as defined in Section 5.1.\n*   **Independent Auditor:** A qualified, third-party audit firm, pre-approved by the Compliance Committee, with no material relationship to the Company that would impair its objectivity.\n*   **Segregated Account:** A custody or bank account legally separated from the Company's operating accounts, designated solely for holding customer reserve assets, and not subject to claims by the Company's creditors.\n*   **Attestation:** A limited-scope examination performed by an independent auditor resulting in a report providing assurance on specific assertions (e.g., reserve composition and value at a point in time).\n*   **Full-Scope Audit:** A comprehensive examination of the reserve management framework, including internal controls, custody arrangements, and valuation methodologies, resulting in an audit opinion.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\nIt is the policy of [Company Name] to maintain at all times reserve assets equal to 100% of the face value of all outstanding stablecoins, held in segregated accounts. These reserves must consist solely of HQLA.

All updates require approval from the Company's Compliance Committee.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements\nThis policy is designed to satisfy and incorporate principles from relevant regulatory frameworks, including but not limited to:\n*   The stablecoin issuance principles outlined by the President's Working Group on Financial Markets (PWG), the FDIC, and the OCC.\n*   Relevant state money transmitter and virtual currency regulations (e.g., NYDFS Part 200).\n*   International standards from bodies such as the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision regarding stablecoin arrangements.\n*   Applicable accounting standards and attestation/audit guidelines (GAAP, ISAE, SSAE).\n\n---\n**Policy Version:** 1.0  \n**Effective Date:** [Date]  \n**Approved By:** [Name of Compliance Committee Chair/CEO]  \n**Next Review Date:** [One Year from Effective Date]\n```"

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Faroe Islands\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-02-07T10:41:28.077471\n\n## Executive Summary\nCRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently operates with no documented policies or compliance framework for stablecoin issuance in the Faroe Islands. All fundamental regulatory requirements are unmet, representing severe legal, operational, and reputational risks. Immediate cessation of operations is recommended until a comprehensive compliance program is developed and regulatory authorization obtained. The organization must prioritize establishing basic legal authorization and AML/CFT controls before any customer-facing activities can resume. This represents a complete regulatory framework gap requiring urgent executive attention and significant resource allocation.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must maintain 1:1 reserves in high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) with regular independent audits\n\n**Current Status:** No documented reserve management policy exists\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of reserve management framework, audit requirements, or asset quality standards\n\n**Impact:** Regulatory enforcement action, license revocation, financial penalties, loss of customer trust, potential insolvency\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive reserve management policy specifying: 1) Asset composition requirements (cash, government securities, etc.), 2) Segregation of customer funds, 3) Monthly independent attestations, 4) Quarterly full-scope audits by approved auditors\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must obtain authorization/license from Faroese Financial Supervisory Authority (Føroya Fjármálaeftirlit)\n\n**Current Status:** No licensing framework or regulatory engagement policy\n\n**Gap:** No documented process for regulatory licensing, ongoing reporting, or supervisory engagement\n\n**Impact:** Operating illegally, immediate cease-and-desist orders, criminal liability for directors, inability to access banking services\n\n**Recommendation:** 1) Immediately cease operations until licensing obtained, 2) Establish regulatory affairs function, 3) Develop licensing application roadmap, 4) Create ongoing reporting calendar for regulatory submissions\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance including customer due diligence (CDD), transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting\n\n**Current Status:** No AML/CFT program documented\n\n**Gap:** Missing entire anti-money laundering framework required for financial institutions\n\n**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, criminal prosecution, loss of correspondent banking relationships, reputational damage\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement full AML/CFT program including: 1) Risk assessment methodology, 2) Customer identification program (CIP), 3) Enhanced due diligence for high-risk customers, 4) Transaction monitoring system, 5) Designated compliance officer, 6) Annual independent testing\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including clear disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop consumer protection framework: 1) Clear terms of service and risk disclosures, 2) Guaranteed redemption at par value, 3) Formal complaint handling process, 4) Customer education materials, 5) Data protection protocols\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity requirements for payment systems\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish operational resilience program: 1) Business impact analysis, 2) Disaster recovery and business continuity plans, 3) Cybersecurity framework (NIST/ISO), 4) Incident response plan, 5) Regular penetration testing\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-006\n**Requirement:** Capital adequacy and liquidity requirements for financial institutions\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop capital and liquidity management framework: 1) Minimum capital requirements based on risk profile, 2) Liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) monitoring, 3) Stress testing scenarios, 4) Capital conservation buffer\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌
