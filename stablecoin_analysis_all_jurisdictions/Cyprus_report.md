# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T21:20:39.904374

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no documented policies addressing stablecoin regulatory requirements in Cyprus. All fundamental regulatory areas show 'not met' status, creating severe legal, operational, and reputational risks. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive compliance framework before any stablecoin operations commence. The most critical gaps requiring immediate attention are licensing/authorization and AML/CTF compliance, as operating without these constitutes illegal activity with severe consequences.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Authorization/Licensing for stablecoin issuance and services (CySEC/ECB requirements)

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing licensing requirements for stablecoin operations in Cyprus. No framework for obtaining necessary approvals from CySEC or meeting ECB standards for electronic money institutions.

**Impact:** Legal prohibition from operating, severe financial penalties, criminal liability for directors, reputational damage, and potential business shutdown.

**Recommendation:** Immediately develop a licensing roadmap policy outlining steps to obtain necessary authorizations from CySEC and comply with ECB requirements for electronic money/payment institutions.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance (Cyprus AML Law, EU AMLD5/6)

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** No AML/CTF program, customer due diligence procedures, transaction monitoring, or suspicious activity reporting mechanisms specific to stablecoin transactions.

**Impact:** Significant regulatory fines, license revocation, criminal prosecution, inability to establish banking relationships, and inclusion in regulatory blacklists.

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive AML/CTF policy including: 1) Risk-based customer identification and verification (KYC), 2) Transaction monitoring for unusual patterns, 3) Suspicious activity reporting procedures, 4) Ongoing due diligence requirements.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Capital adequacy and reserve requirements (MiCA framework principles)

**Recommendation:** Create capital adequacy policy specifying: 1) Minimum reserve requirements, 2) Composition of reserve assets, 3) Liquidity management procedures, 4) Regular reserve attestation/audit requirements.

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements (EU consumer protection directives)

**Recommendation:** Implement consumer protection policy including: 1) Clear risk disclosure documents, 2) Transparent fee structures, 3) Redemption procedure documentation, 4) Complaint handling framework, 5) Terms of service compliance with EU consumer rights.

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity (EU DORA, NIS2 Directive)

**Recommendation:** Establish operational resilience policy covering: 1) Cybersecurity controls and testing, 2) Business continuity and disaster recovery plans, 3) Incident response procedures, 4) Third-party service provider due diligence.
