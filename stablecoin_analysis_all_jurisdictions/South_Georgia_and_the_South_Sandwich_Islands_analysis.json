This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-02-12T14:09:52.777784\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company currently has no documented policies addressing stablecoin regulatory requirements for South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands jurisdiction. Based on standard financial regulatory frameworks and emerging stablecoin regulations globally, there are critical gaps across all major compliance areas. Immediate action is required to develop comprehensive policies and procedures to address authorization requirements, reserve management, consumer protection, AML/CFT, cybersecurity, and governance. The company should engage legal counsel with expertise in digital asset regulation to conduct thorough jurisdictional analysis and develop a complete compliance program before proceeding with stablecoin operations.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance requires formal authorization from financial regulatory authority\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy for regulatory authorization or licensing\n\n**Gap:** Company lacks policies for obtaining necessary regulatory approvals to issue stablecoins in South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands jurisdiction\n\n**Impact:** Potential for regulatory enforcement actions, fines, or prohibition of operations\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish a regulatory licensing framework and engage with relevant authorities to determine authorization requirements\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin reserves must be fully backed and subject to regular independent audits\n\n**Current Status:** No reserve management or audit policies documented\n\n**Gap:** Missing policies for reserve composition, custody, and independent verification of backing assets\n\n**Impact:** Risk of insufficient backing, loss of consumer confidence, and regulatory sanctions\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive reserve management policy including asset composition requirements, custody arrangements, and quarterly independent audit procedures\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance including customer due diligence and transaction monitoring\n\n**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT policies\n\n**Gap:** Missing anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls required for financial services\n\n**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties, potential criminal liability, and loss of banking relationships\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish comprehensive AML/CFT program including KYC procedures, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and staff training\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including redemption rights and disclosures\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement consumer protection framework with clear redemption procedures, fee transparency, and comprehensive risk disclosures\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Cybersecurity and operational resilience requirements\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop cybersecurity framework including secure key management, penetration testing, incident response, and business continuity planning\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-006\n**Requirement:** Governance and risk management framework\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish governance framework with clear roles/responsibilities, risk management committee, and regular compliance reporting\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **regulatory_authorization**: not_met\n❌ **reserve_management**: not_met\n❌ **consumer_protection**: not_met\n❌ **aml_cft_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **cybersecurity**: not_met\n❌ **governance**: not_met\n❌ **record_keeping**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update Summary\nGenerated:
