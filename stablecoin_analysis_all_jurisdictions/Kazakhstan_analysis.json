Current policies are either non-existent or insufficient to meet regulatory expectations. The most critical gaps relate to licensing, reserve management, and AML/CTF compliance, which could result in severe regulatory consequences. Immediate action is required to develop comprehensive policy frameworks and engage with Kazakh regulators to ensure compliance with evolving digital asset regulations. Given the nascent but developing regulatory landscape in Kazakhstan, proactive compliance measures are essential to establish operational legitimacy and mitigate regulatory risks."

Policy Title\nStablecoin Issuance and Management Cybersecurity and Operational Resilience Policy\n\n## 2. Purpose and Scope\n### Purpose\nThis policy establishes a comprehensive cybersecurity and operational resilience framework to protect stablecoin issuance, redemption, reserve management, and transaction systems from internal and external threats. It ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of digital assets, sensitive data, and critical operational functions.\n\n### Scope\nThis policy applies to:\n- All personnel (employees, contractors, consultants) involved in stablecoin operations\n- All systems, networks, applications, and data repositories used for stablecoin issuance, management, reserve custody, and transaction processing\n- All third-party service providers with access to stablecoin systems or data\n- All geographic locations where the organization conducts stablecoin-related activities\n\n## 3.

Procedures\n\n### A. Secure Key Management\n1.  **Key Generation & Storage:**\n    - Private keys for reserve assets and operational wallets must be generated using certified, cryptographically secure random number generators.\n    - A minimum of 95% of reserve asset backing must be held in cold storage.\n    - Cold storage keys must be stored in geographically distributed, high-security vaults (e.g., safety deposit boxes, dedicated HSMs in secure facilities).\n    - Access to cold storage requires dual control and split knowledge among designated Key Personnel.\n2.  **Key Usage:**\n    - Keys for hot wallets must be stored in Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) or secure, air-gapped machines.\n    - Automated systems shall never have unrestricted access to full private keys.\n    - All key usage must be logged to an immutable audit trail.\n\n### B. Multi-Signature Protocols\n1.  **Reserve Transactions:** Any movement of significant reserve assets (threshold to be defined in associated standards) requires a minimum of M-of-N multi-signature approval, where 'N' is the total number of Key Personnel and 'M' is a quorum (e.g., 3-of-5).\n2.  **Operational Changes:** Changes to critical system parameters, smart contract upgrades, or administrative functions must require multi-signature approval from a designated technical governance council.\n3.  **Key Custody:** The shards or components of multi-signature setups must be held by different individuals in separate physical and logical environments.\n\n### C. Incident Response Plan (IRP)\n1.  **Preparation:**\n    - Establish a dedicated Cybersecurity Incident Response Team (CIRT) with defined roles.\n    - Maintain and regularly test communication trees and contact lists.\n2.  **Identification & Containment:**\n    - Implement 24/7 monitoring for anomalous activities.\n    - Upon detection of a potential incident, the CIRT Lead will activate the IRP.\n    - Immediate actions will be taken to contain the incident, which may include temporarily suspending minting, burning, or transfers.\n3.  **Eradication, Recovery, & Communication:**\n    - Root cause analysis will be performed.\n    - Systems will be restored from clean backups after eradication of the threat.\n    - A pre-approved communication plan will be executed to inform regulators, stakeholders, and the public transparently, following regulatory guidelines.\n4.  **Post-Incident Review:**\n    - A full report will be generated, and lessons learned will be integrated into the security framework.\n\n### D. Security Audits\n1.  **Internal Audits:** Quarterly internal reviews of access logs, key usage logs, and system configurations.\n2.  **External Audits:**\n    - **Annual Comprehensive Audit:** Engage a reputable third-party cybersecurity firm to conduct penetration testing, code review (for smart contracts), and a review of security policies and procedures.\n    - **Reserve Attestation:** Engage a qualified third-party accounting firm to provide regular (at least monthly) attestations on the sufficiency and custody of reserve assets.\n3.  **Findings Remediation:** All audit findings will be tracked in a risk register and remediated within agreed-upon timeframes based on severity.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n- All personnel must complete annual cybersecurity awareness training specific to digital assets.\n- The Chief Technology Officer (CTO) or equivalent is responsible for the implementation of this policy.\n- The CIRT is responsible for maintaining and executing the IRP.\n- Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination, and legal consequences.\n- Compliance with this policy will be a key component of internal audit reviews and management reporting to the Board of Directors.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule\nThis policy shall be reviewed and updated:\n- **Annually** as part of the standard policy review cycle.\n- **Immediately** following a significant cybersecurity incident.\n- **Promptly** upon changes in relevant laws, regulations, or industry standards.\n- All updates require approval from the designated policy governance committee.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements\nThis policy is designed to align with principles and requirements set forth by relevant regulatory bodies, including but not limited to:\n- **Financial Stability Board (FSB):** Recommendations for the Regulation, Supervision and Oversight of Global Stablecoin Arrangements.\n- **Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS):** Prudential treatment of cryptoasset exposures.\n- **National/Regional Financial Regulators (e.g., NYDFS, MAS, FCA, MiCA):** Specific requirements for stablecoin issuers regarding custody, reserve management, operational resilience, and consumer protection.\n- **Cybersecurity Frameworks:** NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and NIST SP 800-53 controls relevant to financial systems.\n```"

Current policies are either non-existent or insufficient to meet regulatory expectations. The most critical gaps relate to licensing, reserve management, and AML/CTF compliance, which could result in severe regulatory consequences. Immediate action is required to develop comprehensive policy frameworks and engage with Kazakh regulators to ensure compliance with evolving digital asset regulations. Given the nascent but developing regulatory landscape in Kazakhstan, proactive compliance measures are essential to establish operational legitimacy and mitigate regulatory risks.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Legal authorization and licensing for stablecoin issuance and operations in Kazakhstan\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found regarding licensing requirements\n\n**Gap:** Company lacks policies addressing the need for specific licenses from the National Bank of Kazakhstan or other regulatory bodies to operate stablecoin services\n\n**Impact:** Potential for regulatory enforcement actions, fines, or complete shutdown of operations\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop licensing strategy and policy framework;
