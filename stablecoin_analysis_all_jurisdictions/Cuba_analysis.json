Policy Title\nCuba Stablecoin Regulatory Compliance and Market Entry Policy\n\n## 2. Purpose and Scope\n### 2.1 Purpose\nThis policy establishes a structured framework to ensure full compliance with Cuban legal and regulatory requirements for any potential issuance, distribution, trading, or operational activity involving stablecoins or related cryptocurrency services connected to the Republic of Cuba. Its primary aim is to mitigate legal, financial, and reputational risks by mandating thorough due diligence and proactive compliance measures before any market engagement.\n\n### 2.2 Scope\nThis policy applies to:\n*   All employees, contractors, and agents of the organization.\n*   All subsidiaries and affiliated entities under organizational control.\n*   Any proposed or actual business activities, including partnerships, marketing, and technical operations, that involve Cuban nationals, residents, financial institutions, or are physically or legally conducted within Cuban territory.\n*   The issuance, management, promotion, and exchange of any fiat-referenced stablecoin (e.g., peso-backed, USD-backed) intended for the Cuban market.\n\n## 3. Definitions\n*   **Stablecoin:** A type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified asset or a pool of assets, typically a fiat currency like the Cuban Peso (CUP) or Convertible Peso (CUC), or a foreign currency such as the US Dollar (USD).\n*   **Cuban Market:** Any business activity directed at, accessible by, or servicing individuals or entities resident in Cuba, or utilizing Cuban financial infrastructure.\n*   **Geographic Restriction:** Technical and contractual controls implemented to prevent users from designated jurisdictions from accessing a product or service.\n*   **Cuban Legal Counsel:** A law firm or qualified attorney licensed to practice in Cuba, with demonstrable expertise in Cuban financial regulations, monetary law, and emerging technology statutes.\n*   **Compliance Framework:** A documented system of internal controls, procedures, monitoring, and reporting designed to ensure adherence to all applicable laws and regulations.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\nIt is the policy of this organization to strictly prohibit any stablecoin-related operations, marketing, or user onboarding involving the Cuban market until a comprehensive, country-specific legal review has been completed and an approved compliance framework is fully operational. The organization is committed to the highest standards of legal compliance and will not engage in jurisdictions where regulatory clarity is absent or where operations would violate local law. If Cuban regulations expressly prohibit stablecoin activities, the organization will enforce absolute geographic restrictions.\n\n## 5. Procedures\nTo implement this policy, the following procedures must be executed sequentially:\n\n### 5.1 Phase 1: Regulatory Research & Analysis\n1.  **Engagement of Counsel:** The Legal Department must retain qualified **Cuban Legal Counsel** to conduct a comprehensive analysis.\n2.  **Research Mandate:** Counsel's analysis must address, at a minimum:\n    *   The legal status of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins under Cuban law.\n    *   Central Bank of Cuba regulations on virtual assets, monetary issuance, and foreign exchange controls.\n    *   Licensing requirements for money transmission, payment services, or electronic money issuance.\n    *   Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF), and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) obligations specific to Cuba.\n    *   Tax implications and reporting duties.\n    *   Data privacy and localization laws.\n    *   Any restrictions on foreign entities providing financial services.\n3.  **Formal Opinion:** A written legal memorandum detailing findings, risks, and permissibility must be submitted to the organization's Legal and Compliance leadership.\n\n### 5.2 Phase 2: Framework Development & Decision Point\n1.  **Assessment:** Based on the legal opinion, Legal and Compliance will recommend one of three paths:\n    *   **Path A (Green Light):** Operations are permissible under clear conditions. Proceed to develop a Cuba-Specific Compliance Framework.\n    *   **Path B (Prohibited):** Operations are currently prohibited. Implement permanent Geographic Restrictions (see 5.3).\n    *   **Path C (Ambiguous/High Risk):** Regulations are unclear or pose unacceptable risk. Maintain status quo (no operations) and schedule a review in 12 months or upon significant regulatory change.\n2.  **Framework Development (If Path A):** A working group led by Compliance will draft a **Cuba-Specific Compliance Framework** document, incorporating all mandatory local requirements into our existing control environment (AML, KYC, sanctions screening, reporting, etc.).\n\n### 5.3 Phase 3: Implementation or Restriction\n1.  **For Permissible Operations (Path A):**\n    *   The finalized Compliance Framework must be approved by the Chief Compliance Officer and General Counsel.\n    *   All relevant staff must be trained on the framework.\n    *   Technical and operational controls must be tested and validated before launch.\n2.  **For Prohibited Operations (Path B):**\n    *   The Technology Department must implement **Geographic Restrictions** using IP address blocking, GPS fencing (if applicable), and explicit prohibitions in Terms of Service.\n    *   Ongoing monitoring must be established to detect and block attempts to circumvent restrictions from Cuban jurisdictions.\n    *   Marketing and business development teams are expressly forbidden from targeting the Cuban market.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n*   **Mandatory Adherence:** No department may initiate, pilot, or partner on any Cuba-related stablecoin activity outside this policy's procedures.\n*   **Certification:** The General Counsel must certify completion of Phase 1 (legal review) before any resources are allocated to framework development.\n*   **Sanctions Screening:** All operations must comply with applicable international sanctions regimes. Cuba-specific sanctions screening is mandatory regardless of the outcome of the legal review.\n*   **Recordkeeping:** All legal opinions, framework documents, risk assessments, and decision logs must be retained for a minimum of seven (7) years.\n*   **Violations:** Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination, and will be reported to the relevant internal governance committees.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule\nThis policy shall be reviewed and updated:\n*   **Annually** by the Legal and Compliance Departments.\n*   **Immediately** upon knowledge of a material change in Cuban cryptocurrency, financial, or monetary law.\n*   Prior to the organization reconsidering any decision made under Section 5.2.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements\nThis policy is designed to address the evolving regulatory landscape in Cuba. Primary regulatory bodies and legal sources requiring ongoing monitoring include:\n*   **Central Bank of Cuba (Banco Central de Cuba - BCC):** Issuer of monetary regulations and likely primary regulator for virtual assets.\n*   **Cuban Ministry of Finance and Prices (Ministerio de Finanzas y Precios - MFP):** Responsible for tax policy and financial oversight.\n*   **Cuban Legal Codes:** Including the Economic Constitution, Penal Code, and laws governing foreign investment.\n*   **Resolutions and Notices:** Any official gazettes or communications from Cuban authorities regarding digital assets or payment systems.\n*   **International Sanctions Lists:** Including those administered by OFAC (US), UN, and other relevant bodies.\n\n---\n*Policy is a living document. All personnel are responsible for understanding its contents and adhering to its directives.*\n```"

Definitions\n*   **Stablecoin:** A type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified asset or a pool of assets, typically a fiat currency like the Cuban Peso (CUP) or Convertible Peso (CUC), or a foreign currency such as the US Dollar (USD).\n*   **Cuban Market:** Any business activity directed at, accessible by, or servicing individuals or entities resident in Cuba, or utilizing Cuban financial infrastructure.\n*   **Geographic Restriction:** Technical and contractual controls implemented to prevent users from designated jurisdictions from accessing a product or service.\n*   **Cuban Legal Counsel:** A law firm or qualified attorney licensed to practice in Cuba, with demonstrable expertise in Cuban financial regulations, monetary law, and emerging technology statutes.\n*   **Compliance Framework:** A documented system of internal controls, procedures, monitoring, and reporting designed to ensure adherence to all applicable laws and regulations.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\nIt is the policy of this organization to strictly prohibit any stablecoin-related operations, marketing, or user onboarding involving the Cuban market until a comprehensive, country-specific legal review has been completed and an approved compliance framework is fully operational. The organization is committed to the highest standards of legal compliance and will not engage in jurisdictions where regulatory clarity is absent or where operations would violate local law. If Cuban regulations expressly prohibit stablecoin activities, the organization will enforce absolute geographic restrictions.\n\n## 5. Procedures\nTo implement this policy, the following procedures must be executed sequentially:\n\n### 5.1 Phase 1: Regulatory Research & Analysis\n1.  **Engagement of Counsel:** The Legal Department must retain qualified **Cuban Legal Counsel** to conduct a comprehensive analysis.\n2.  **Research Mandate:** Counsel's analysis must address, at a minimum:\n    *   The legal status of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins under Cuban law.\n    *   Central Bank of Cuba regulations on virtual assets, monetary issuance, and foreign exchange controls.\n    *   Licensing requirements for money transmission, payment services, or electronic money issuance.\n    *   Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF), and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) obligations specific to Cuba.\n    *   Tax implications and reporting duties.\n    *   Data privacy and localization laws.\n    *   Any restrictions on foreign entities providing financial services.\n3.  **Formal Opinion:** A written legal memorandum detailing findings, risks, and permissibility must be submitted to the organization's Legal and Compliance leadership.\n\n### 5.2 Phase 2: Framework Development & Decision Point\n1.  **Assessment:** Based on the legal opinion, Legal and Compliance will recommend one of three paths:\n    *   **Path A (Green Light):** Operations are permissible under clear conditions. Proceed to develop a Cuba-Specific Compliance Framework.\n    *   **Path B (Prohibited):** Operations are currently prohibited. Implement permanent Geographic Restrictions (see 5.3).\n    *   **Path C (Ambiguous/High Risk):** Regulations are unclear or pose unacceptable risk. Maintain status quo (no operations) and schedule a review in 12 months or upon significant regulatory change.\n2.  **Framework Development (If Path A):** A working group led by Compliance will draft a **Cuba-Specific Compliance Framework** document, incorporating all mandatory local requirements into our existing control environment (AML, KYC, sanctions screening, reporting, etc.).\n\n### 5.3 Phase 3: Implementation or Restriction\n1.  **For Permissible Operations (Path A):**\n    *   The finalized Compliance Framework must be approved by the Chief Compliance Officer and General Counsel.\n    *   All relevant staff must be trained on the framework.\n    *   Technical and operational controls must be tested and validated before launch.\n2.  **For Prohibited Operations (Path B):**\n    *   The Technology Department must implement **Geographic Restrictions** using IP address blocking, GPS fencing (if applicable), and explicit prohibitions in Terms of Service.\n    *   Ongoing monitoring must be established to detect and block attempts to circumvent restrictions from Cuban jurisdictions.\n    *   Marketing and business development teams are expressly forbidden from targeting the Cuban market.\n\n## 6.

Cuba-specific sanctions screening is mandatory regardless of the outcome of the legal review.\n*   **Recordkeeping:** All legal opinions, framework documents, risk assessments, and decision logs must be retained for a minimum of seven (7) years.\n*   **Violations:** Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination, and will be reported to the relevant internal governance committees.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule\nThis policy shall be reviewed and updated:\n*   **Annually** by the Legal and Compliance Departments.\n*   **Immediately** upon knowledge of a material change in Cuban cryptocurrency, financial, or monetary law.\n*   Prior to the organization reconsidering any decision made under Section 5.2.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements\nThis policy is designed to address the evolving regulatory landscape in Cuba. Primary regulatory bodies and legal sources requiring ongoing monitoring include:\n*   **Central Bank of Cuba (Banco Central de Cuba - BCC):** Issuer of monetary regulations and likely primary regulator for virtual assets.\n*   **Cuban Ministry of Finance and Prices (Ministerio de Finanzas y Precios - MFP):** Responsible for tax policy and financial oversight.\n*   **Cuban Legal Codes:** Including the Economic Constitution, Penal Code, and laws governing foreign investment.\n*   **Resolutions and Notices:** Any official gazettes or communications from Cuban authorities regarding digital assets or payment systems.\n*   **International Sanctions Lists:** Including those administered by OFAC (US), UN, and other relevant bodies.\n\n---\n*Policy is a living document.
