This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Cabo Verde\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-01-30T20:00:25.965199\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company currently exhibits complete non-compliance with Cabo Verde's stablecoin regulatory requirements. No policies exist to address any of the core regulatory obligations for stablecoin issuers. This represents an extreme compliance risk that would prevent legal operation in Cabo Verde's jurisdiction. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive compliance program addressing all identified gaps, beginning with the critical priority items related to regulatory authorization, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance. The company should engage local legal counsel in Cabo Verde to obtain definitive regulatory guidance before proceeding with any stablecoin-related activities in this jurisdiction.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance requires authorization from Cabo Verde's financial regulator (Banco de Cabo Verde)\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy for regulatory authorization processes\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of procedures for obtaining necessary regulatory approvals for stablecoin operations in Cabo Verde\n\n**Impact:** Potential regulatory enforcement actions, fines, or prohibition of operations in Cabo Verde jurisdiction\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop and implement a Regulatory Authorization Framework with clear procedures for engaging with Banco de Cabo Verde, application processes, and compliance documentation requirements\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must maintain adequate reserves to back all issued tokens\n\n**Current Status:** No reserve management policy exists\n\n**Gap:** Missing policies for reserve composition, custody, auditing, and transparency requirements\n\n**Impact:** Risk of insolvency, loss of consumer confidence, and regulatory sanctions for inadequate backing of stablecoin liabilities\n\n**Recommendation:** Create a Comprehensive Reserve Management Policy detailing: 1) Acceptable reserve assets, 2) Custody arrangements, 3) Regular independent audits, 4) Public disclosure requirements, 5) Liquidity management procedures\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting\n\n**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT program\n\n**Gap:** Lack of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls required for financial services in Cabo Verde\n\n**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, potential criminal liability, and reputational damage\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement a full AML/CFT Program including: 1) Customer Identification Program (CIP), 2) Enhanced Due Diligence procedures, 3) Transaction monitoring system, 4) Suspicious Activity Reporting protocols, 5) Employee training program\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop a Consumer Protection Framework covering: 1) Clear terms of service, 2) Redemption procedures and timelines, 3) Complaint resolution mechanisms, 4) Risk disclosures, 5) Data privacy protections\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity requirements\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish an Operational Risk Management Framework including: 1) Cybersecurity standards, 2) Business continuity and disaster recovery plans, 3) Third-party vendor management, 4) Incident response procedures, 5) Regular security assessments\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-006\n**Requirement:** Governance and oversight requirements including board responsibility and compliance function\n\n**Recommendation:** Create a Governance Framework defining: 1) Board compliance responsibilities, 2) Independent compliance function, 3) Regular compliance reporting, 4) Whistleblower procedures, 5) Compliance testing and monitoring\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **regulatory_authorization**: not_met\n❌ **reserve_management**: not_met\n❌ **aml_cft_compliance**: not_met\n❌
