# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-12T18:01:19.821994

## Executive Summary
The company appears to have no documented policies addressing stablecoin regulation in Northern Cyprus, resulting in critical compliance gaps across all regulatory domains. The unique political status of Northern Cyprus creates additional complexity, as it is not internationally recognized, making jurisdictional determination challenging. All identified gaps are rated as critical or high priority due to the fundamental nature of the missing policies. Immediate action is required to establish basic compliance frameworks before any stablecoin operations can be considered. The company should prioritize obtaining legal clarity on applicable regulations, implementing AML/CTF controls, and addressing licensing requirements before developing operational policies.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Legal authorization to issue stablecoins in Northern Cyprus

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** Northern Cyprus (Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus) is not internationally recognized, creating legal uncertainty about which regulatory framework applies. There is no clear policy addressing whether the company can legally operate stablecoin services in this jurisdiction.

**Impact:** Operating without proper authorization could result in legal action, fines, seizure of assets, and reputational damage. The lack of international recognition creates significant jurisdictional risks.

**Recommendation:** 1. Conduct comprehensive legal analysis to determine applicable regulatory framework (Turkish law, potential EU influence, or local TRNC regulations). 2. Engage local legal counsel in Northern Cyprus. 3. Develop a jurisdictional risk assessment policy. 4. Consider suspending operations until legal clarity is obtained.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** No evidence of AML/CTF policies, procedures, or controls specific to stablecoin operations in Northern Cyprus. This includes lack of customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and record-keeping requirements.

**Impact:** High risk of regulatory sanctions, financial penalties, loss of banking relationships, and potential criminal liability for facilitating illicit financial activities.

**Recommendation:** 1. Implement comprehensive AML/CTF program aligned with FATF recommendations. 2. Develop customer identification and verification procedures. 3. Establish transaction monitoring systems. 4. Designate a compliance officer. 5. Implement ongoing employee training.

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Licensing and registration with financial authorities

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** No policy addressing licensing requirements, registration procedures, or ongoing reporting obligations to any financial regulatory body in Northern Cyprus or applicable jurisdictions.

**Impact:** Operating without required licenses could result in immediate shutdown orders, substantial fines, and criminal charges against company officers.

**Recommendation:** 1. Determine which regulatory bodies have jurisdiction. 2. Map all potential licensing requirements. 3. Develop licensing strategy and application process. 4. Create ongoing regulatory reporting procedures. 5. Consider regulatory sandbox options if available.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Reserve requirements and asset backing for stablecoins

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop reserve management policy with clear asset composition rules. 2. Implement regular third-party audits. 3. Establish transparent reporting mechanisms. 4. Create redemption procedures. 5. Consider 1:1 backing with high-quality liquid assets.

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop comprehensive terms of service and user agreements. 2. Create clear risk disclosure documents. 3. Establish consumer complaint resolution process. 4. Implement data protection and privacy policies compliant with relevant standards.

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity

**Recommendation:** 1. Implement comprehensive cybersecurity framework. 2. Develop business continuity and disaster recovery plans. 3. Establish incident response procedures. 4. Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing. 5. Implement multi-signature wallets and cold storage solutions.
