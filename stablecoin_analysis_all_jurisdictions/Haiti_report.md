# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-31T00:08:05.316770

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits significant compliance gaps across all major regulatory domains for stablecoin operations in Haiti. Current policies are either non-existent or insufficient to meet regulatory expectations. Critical gaps exist in legal authorization, AML/CTF compliance, and reserve management. Immediate action is required to develop comprehensive policies and implement controls to avoid regulatory enforcement actions, legal penalties, and reputational damage. Given the limited regulatory research results, additional due diligence is urgently needed to understand Haiti's specific regulatory framework for stablecoins and digital assets.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Legal authorization to issue stablecoins in Haiti

**Current Status:** No documented policy regarding authorization requirements

**Gap:** Company lacks policies addressing the need for formal authorization from Haitian regulatory bodies (likely Banque de la République d'Haïti) to issue or operate stablecoin services

**Impact:** Operating without proper authorization could result in legal penalties, fines, seizure of assets, and complete shutdown of operations in Haiti

**Recommendation:** Establish a regulatory licensing policy requiring formal authorization from Haitian authorities before offering stablecoin services. Create a process for obtaining and maintaining necessary licenses.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CTF policies specific to stablecoin operations

**Gap:** Missing comprehensive AML/CTF framework tailored to stablecoin transactions, including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting

**Impact:** Exposure to financial crime risks, regulatory sanctions, reputational damage, and potential criminal liability for facilitating illicit transactions

**Recommendation:** Develop and implement a comprehensive AML/CTF program including KYC procedures, transaction monitoring systems, suspicious activity reporting protocols, and employee training specific to stablecoin operations

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Reserve requirements and asset backing verification

**Recommendation:** Establish reserve management policies requiring 1:1 backing with high-quality liquid assets, independent custody arrangements, and regular third-party audits with public attestations

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive consumer protection policies including clear risk disclosures, redemption procedures, fee transparency, and complaint resolution mechanisms

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity standards

**Recommendation:** Implement operational resilience framework including cybersecurity controls, disaster recovery plans, incident response procedures, and regular penetration testing
