# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T23:52:05.026604

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no documented policies addressing stablecoin operations in Guinea, representing a complete regulatory compliance failure. All fundamental regulatory requirements for stablecoin issuance and operation are unmet. Immediate action is required to suspend operations and develop a comprehensive compliance framework. The lack of AML/CTF controls and legal authorization poses severe regulatory and reputational risks. Priority should be given to establishing legal standing and AML compliance before any operational activities can proceed in Guinea.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Legal framework for stablecoin issuance and operation in Guinea

**Current Status:** No documented policy exists

**Gap:** Complete absence of any policy addressing stablecoin operations, issuance, redemption, or reserve management in Guinea

**Impact:** Operating without legal authorization could result in regulatory enforcement actions, fines, license revocation, and criminal liability

**Recommendation:** Immediately suspend stablecoin operations in Guinea until legal framework is established. Engage local legal counsel to research Guinea's financial regulations and central bank directives regarding digital assets.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance for digital assets

**Current Status:** No specific policy for stablecoin AML/CTF

**Gap:** Lack of customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting procedures specific to stablecoin transactions

**Impact:** High risk of facilitating illicit financial activities, potential regulatory sanctions, and reputational damage

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive AML/CTF policy for stablecoin operations including KYC procedures, transaction monitoring thresholds, and reporting protocols aligned with FATF recommendations

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Reserve management and transparency requirements

**Recommendation:** Establish reserve management policy requiring 1:1 backing with high-quality liquid assets, regular third-party audits, and public attestations

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive consumer protection framework including clear terms of service, redemption procedures, and complaint resolution mechanisms
