## Regulatory Requirements Summary

### **Regulatory Compliance Summary: Cryptocurrency, Blockchain & Digital Assets**

**Based on Research Findings: Nubank’s Conditional OCC Approval**

---

#### **1. Key Regulatory Requirements**
- **Federal Banking Charter:** Entities seeking to offer integrated traditional and digital asset services in the U.S. must obtain approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to operate as a national bank.
- **Conditional Approval Process:** Regulators impose specific, unmet conditions prior to final authorization, ensuring robust compliance frameworks are established before full operation.
- **Digital Asset Custody:** Offering custody services requires adherence to federal banking regulations, including stringent safeguarding, reporting, and risk management protocols.

#### **2. Compliance Obligations**
- **Dual Compliance Regime:** Federally chartered banks engaging in digital asset activities must comply with both traditional banking regulations (e.g., capital requirements, AML/CFT) and emerging digital asset-specific guidance.
- **Programmatic Conditions:** Entities must satisfy OCC-stipulated conditions related to governance, risk management, internal controls, and consumer protection before operational launch.
- **Ongoing Supervision:** As a national bank, the entity will be subject to continuous examination by the OCC, including scrutiny of digital asset service integrations.

#### **3. Recent Regulatory Changes**
- **OCC’s Evolving Stance:** The conditional approval reflects the OCC’s continued openness (under certain frameworks) to chartering banks that intend to engage in digital asset activities, following previous interpretive letters on digital custody and stablecoin activities.
- **Integrated Service Model:** Regulators are increasingly evaluating applications from fintechs seeking to combine traditional banking (deposits, lending) with digital asset services under a single federal charter.

#### **4. Jurisdiction-Specific Requirements**
- **United States (Federal):**
  - **Primary Regulator:** Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).
  - **Approval Type:** Conditional approval signifies a multi-stage chartering process with predefined milestones.
  - **Permissible Activities:** Includes deposit-taking, lending, credit card services, and **digital asset custody**—all under a unified federal regulatory umbrella.
  - **State-Level Considerations:** While a national charter preempts state banking laws, money transmitter licenses may still be required for certain digital asset activities depending on state-specific interpretations.

#### **5. Enforcement Actions & Guidance**
- **Precedent-Setting Action:** This conditional approval acts as de facto regulatory guidance, signaling the OCC’s criteria for evaluating integrated traditional/digital asset banking proposals.
- **Enforcement Implications:** Failure to meet conditions or comply with ongoing obligations could result in supervisory actions, restrictions, or charter revocation.
- **Industry Guidance:** The OCC is using specific approvals to shape expectations for operational resilience, consumer protection, and risk isolation in digital asset banking.

### **Analysis & Implications**
This development highlights a **pathway to regulatory legitimacy** for fintechs and digital asset service providers in the U.S. through the federal banking system. It underscores:
- A trend toward **consolidated regulatory oversight** for hybrid financial/digital asset entities.
- The **critical importance of pre-engagement with regulators** and satisfying conditional requirements.
- The **elevated compliance burden**—but also potential competitive advantage—of operating under a national bank charter with digital asset permissions.

**Compliance Priority:** Entities pursuing similar models must prioritize **enhanced governance frameworks, capital planning, and integrated risk management** that satisfy both traditional and digital asset regulatory expectations.
