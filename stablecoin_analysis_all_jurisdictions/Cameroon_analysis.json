References to Regulatory Requirements  \nThis policy is predicated on the following regulatory landscape:\n- **Primary Reference:** The monetary and banking regulations of the CEMAC zone, governed by BEAC and supervised by COBAC. As no specific stablecoin regulation exists, the company applies a precautionary principle under general financial laws.\n- **Guiding Principle:** The company adheres to the core regulatory tenets of consumer protection, financial stability, anti‑money laundering (AML), and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT), as mandated for all financial activities in the region.\n- **Future Alignment:** This policy will be amended to align precisely with any future:  \n  a) BEAC directives on digital assets or stablecoins.  \n  b) COBAC prudential rules for cryptocurrency service providers.  \n  c) National legislation from the Cameroonian Parliament concerning cryptocurrencies.\n\n---\n**Policy Effective Date:** [Date]  \n**Policy Owner:** Legal & Compliance Department  \n**Approved By:** [Name, Title]  \n**Version:** 1.0\n```"

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Cameroon\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-01-30T20:11:15.219321\n\n## Executive Summary\nCRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company appears to have no documented policies addressing stablecoin regulation in Cameroon. Based on standard regulatory expectations for digital assets in the CEMAC region and emerging global standards, there is a complete absence of compliance infrastructure. All identified regulatory requirements are currently not met, creating severe legal, operational, and reputational risks. Immediate action is required to: 1) Suspend operations until regulatory engagement is established, 2) Develop foundational compliance policies, and 3) Obtain necessary regulatory approvals. The company is operating in a high-risk regulatory vacuum with potential for significant enforcement actions.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Legal authorization/licensing for stablecoin issuance or operation in Cameroon\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing licensing requirements for stablecoin operations in Cameroon. No evidence of engagement with regulatory authorities (BEAC, COBAC, or Cameroonian Ministry of Finance).\n\n**Impact:** Risk of immediate regulatory enforcement action, including cease-and-desist orders, fines, and potential criminal liability for operating without required authorization.\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Immediately suspend stablecoin operations in Cameroon until regulatory clarity is obtained. 2. Initiate formal engagement with BEAC (Bank of Central African States) and COBAC (Central African Banking Commission) to understand licensing requirements. 3. Develop a licensing strategy document outlining application requirements and timelines.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance specific to digital assets\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found\n\n**Gap:** No AML/CTF policies tailored to stablecoin operations, including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, or record-keeping requirements for digital asset transactions.\n\n**Impact:** Significant financial crime risks, potential regulatory sanctions, reputational damage, and possible exclusion from the financial system.\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Develop comprehensive AML/CTF policy for stablecoin operations aligned with FATF recommendations and CEMAC regional standards. 2. Implement customer identification program (KYC) for all stablecoin users. 3. Establish transaction monitoring system with thresholds and suspicious activity reporting procedures.\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Create comprehensive consumer disclosure documents detailing all material risks. 2. Establish clear terms of service and user agreements. 3. Implement formal complaint handling and dispute resolution procedures.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Reserve management and transparency for asset-backed stablecoins\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Develop reserve management policy specifying eligible assets, custody requirements, and diversification rules. 2. Establish regular third-party audit schedule. 3. Create public reporting framework for reserve status and composition.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity standards\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Develop comprehensive cybersecurity framework aligned with industry standards. 2. Implement multi-signature wallet controls and cold storage policies. 3. Create incident response plan and business continuity procedures.\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **licensing_authorization**: not_met\n❌ **aml_ctf_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **consumer_protection**: not_met\n❌ **reserve_management**: not_met\n❌ **operational_risk**: not_met\n❌ **tax_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **cross_border_compliance**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update Summary\nGenerated: 2026-01-30T20:12:01.085943\n\n## Overview\nThis document summarizes proposed updates to company policies and standards based on regulatory gap analysis.\n\n## New Policies Required\n\n## Modified Policies\n\n### GAP-001\n**Category:** Legal\n**Current Policy:** No documented policy found\n**Proposed Change:** 1.
