Policy Title  \nStablecoin Operations Suspension and Regulatory Compliance Policy\n\n## 2. Purpose and Scope  \n**Purpose:**  \nThis policy establishes an immediate suspension of all stablecoin-related activities by the company until a clear understanding of the Ethiopian legal and regulatory framework is obtained. It further mandates a structured process for engaging legal experts to research applicable regulations and develop compliant operational protocols.\n\n**Scope:**  \nThis policy applies to all employees, contractors, subsidiaries, and affiliates of the company operating within or in connection with Ethiopia. It covers all activities related to the issuance, distribution, trading, custody, promotion, or any form of operational involvement with stablecoins or similar digital currency instruments pegged to a fiat currency or other assets.\n\n## 3. Definitions  \n- **Stablecoin:** A type of digital currency designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified asset or a pool of assets, typically a fiat currency like the US Dollar or the Ethiopian Birr.\n- **National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE):** The central bank of Ethiopia and the primary financial regulatory authority.\n- **Regulatory Framework:** The collection of laws, regulations, directives, and guidelines issued by the NBE and other relevant Ethiopian governmental bodies governing digital currencies, payment systems, and financial services.\n- **Ethiopian Legal Counsel:** A qualified law firm or legal practitioner licensed to practice in Ethiopia, specializing in financial regulation and/or technology law.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement  \nIt is the policy of this company to conduct all business activities in full compliance with the laws and regulations of Ethiopia. Given the absence of a clear, company-specific policy and the evolving nature of digital currency regulation, **all stablecoin operations are hereby suspended effective immediately.** No new stablecoin initiatives may commence, and existing activities must be wound down in an orderly manner. The company will proactively engage with qualified Ethiopian legal experts to understand the regulatory landscape and will not resume any stablecoin operations until a compliant framework is established, documented, and approved by the Legal Department and Executive Management.\n\n## 5. Procedures  \nTo implement this policy, the following procedures must be followed:\n\n1.  **Immediate Suspension:**\n    *   The Head of Department for any unit involved in stablecoin activities is responsible for issuing a formal suspension directive to their team within 24 hours of this policy's effective date.\n    *   All technological systems facilitating stablecoin transactions (issuance, wallets, exchanges) shall be placed in a \"read-only\" or suspended state, preventing new business activities while allowing for necessary audit and reconciliation.\n\n2.  **Engagement of Legal Counsel:**\n    *   The Legal Department shall, within 7 business days, identify and retain qualified Ethiopian Legal Counsel.\n    *   A formal scope of work shall be agreed upon, mandating research into:\n        *   The NBE's current and proposed regulations on digital/virtual currencies.\n        *   The *National Payment System Proclamation* and any related directives.\n        *   Licensing requirements for payment system operators, money issuers, or financial technology services.\n        *   Foreign exchange controls relevant to stablecoin pegged to non-birr assets.\n        *   Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) obligations.\n        *   Tax treatment of digital currency transactions.\n\n3.  **Regulatory Analysis and Reporting:**\n    *   Ethiopian Legal Counsel shall provide a comprehensive written report detailing their findings, including citations of relevant laws, regulatory gaps, and perceived risks.\n    *   The Legal Department will synthesize this report into an internal \"Regulatory Assessment Memo\" for Executive Management.\n\n4.  **Pathway Determination:**\n    *   Based on the regulatory assessment, the Legal Department, in consultation with management, will determine one of three pathways:\n        a.  Develop and submit a proposal for a full internal compliance policy to resume operations under current regulations.\n        b.  Prepare to apply for necessary licenses or authorizations from the NBE.\n        c.  Recommend the permanent cessation of stablecoin activities in Ethiopia if the regulatory environment is prohibitive.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements  \n- **Mandatory Adherence:** All personnel must comply fully with the operational suspension. Violations will be considered a serious breach of company policy and may result in disciplinary action.\n- **Communication Embargo:** No public or customer communication regarding the potential resumption of stablecoin services may be made without prior written approval from the Legal Department and Head of Communications.\n- **Record Keeping:** All steps taken to suspend operations and all correspondence with legal counsel must be meticulously documented.\n- **Management Oversight:** The Chief Legal Officer (or equivalent) is the designated policy owner and is responsible for certifying compliance to the Board of Directors or relevant governing body on a quarterly basis during the suspension period.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule  \nThis policy shall be reviewed and updated:\n- **Immediately** upon receipt of the final regulatory assessment from Ethiopian Legal Counsel.\n- **Annually** thereafter, or more frequently if significant regulatory changes are announced by the National Bank of Ethiopia.\n- The next scheduled review date is: **[One Year from Effective Date]**\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements  \nThis policy is initiated in direct response to the need for compliance with the broader Ethiopian legal system, with specific (but not exclusive) reference to the need for research into:\n- The Constitution of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia.\n- The *National Bank of Ethiopia Establishment Proclamation* (likely Proclamation No. 591/2008).\n- The *National Payment System Proclamation* (Proclamation No. 718/2011) and subsequent Directives.\n- Relevant AML/CFT Proclamations and Directives.\n- Any public notices, draft laws, or guidance issued by the NBE concerning \"Digital Currency,\" \"Virtual Asset,\" \"Cryptocurrency,\" or \"Stablecoin.\"\n\n---\n**Policy Effective Date:** [Date of Approval]  \n**Policy Owner:** Chief Legal Officer  \n**Approved By:** [Signature of CEO/Board Chair]\n```"

The company will proactively engage with qualified Ethiopian legal experts to understand the regulatory landscape and will not resume any stablecoin operations until a compliant framework is established, documented, and approved by the Legal Department and Executive Management.\n\n## 5. Procedures  \nTo implement this policy, the following procedures must be followed:\n\n1.  **Immediate Suspension:**\n    *   The Head of Department for any unit involved in stablecoin activities is responsible for issuing a formal suspension directive to their team within 24 hours of this policy's effective date.\n    *   All technological systems facilitating stablecoin transactions (issuance, wallets, exchanges) shall be placed in a \"read-only\" or suspended state, preventing new business activities while allowing for necessary audit and reconciliation.\n\n2.  **Engagement of Legal Counsel:**\n    *   The Legal Department shall, within 7 business days, identify and retain qualified Ethiopian Legal Counsel.\n    *   A formal scope of work shall be agreed upon, mandating research into:\n        *   The NBE's current and proposed regulations on digital/virtual currencies.\n        *   The *National Payment System Proclamation* and any related directives.\n        *   Licensing requirements for payment system operators, money issuers, or financial technology services.\n        *   Foreign exchange controls relevant to stablecoin pegged to non-birr assets.\n        *   Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) obligations.\n        *   Tax treatment of digital currency transactions.\n\n3.  **Regulatory Analysis and Reporting:**\n    *   Ethiopian Legal Counsel shall provide a comprehensive written report detailing their findings, including citations of relevant laws, regulatory gaps, and perceived risks.\n    *   The Legal Department will synthesize this report into an internal \"Regulatory Assessment Memo\" for Executive Management.\n\n4.  **Pathway Determination:**\n    *   Based on the regulatory assessment, the Legal Department, in consultation with management, will determine one of three pathways:\n        a.  Develop and submit a proposal for a full internal compliance policy to resume operations under current regulations.\n        b.  Prepare to apply for necessary licenses or authorizations from the NBE.\n        c.  Recommend the permanent cessation of stablecoin activities in Ethiopia if the regulatory environment is prohibitive.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements  \n- **Mandatory Adherence:** All personnel must comply fully with the operational suspension. Violations will be considered a serious breach of company policy and may result in disciplinary action.\n- **Communication Embargo:** No public or customer communication regarding the potential resumption of stablecoin services may be made without prior written approval from the Legal Department and Head of Communications.\n- **Record Keeping:** All steps taken to suspend operations and all correspondence with legal counsel must be meticulously documented.\n- **Management Oversight:** The Chief Legal Officer (or equivalent) is the designated policy owner and is responsible for certifying compliance to the Board of Directors or relevant governing body on a quarterly basis during the suspension period.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule  \nThis policy shall be reviewed and updated:\n- **Immediately** upon receipt of the final regulatory assessment from Ethiopian Legal Counsel.\n- **Annually** thereafter, or more frequently if significant regulatory changes are announced by the National Bank of Ethiopia.\n- The next scheduled review date is: **[One Year from Effective Date]**\n\n## 8.
