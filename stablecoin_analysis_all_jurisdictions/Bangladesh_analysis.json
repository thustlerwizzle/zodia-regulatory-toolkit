This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Bangladesh\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-01-30T18:35:46.781063\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company is in a state of severe non-compliance with Bangladeshi regulations concerning stablecoins. The complete absence of policies creates critical legal, financial, and reputational risks. The regulatory environment is prohibitive, not permissive. Immediate action is required to establish a clear, company-wide prohibition on stablecoins and integrate this prohibition into existing AML and FX control frameworks. All identified gaps are foundational compliance failures, with GAP-001 and GAP-003 representing the most urgent and critical risks to the business.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Bangladesh Bank (Central Bank) prohibits the use of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins for transactions. The Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947, and the Money Laundering Prevention Act, 2012, are typically applied to restrict unauthorized digital currency operations.\n\n**Current Status:** No company policy exists regarding the use, holding, or transaction of stablecoins.\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of any policy framework to address the regulatory prohibition. The company has no defined stance, controls, or employee guidance on stablecoins, creating significant legal and financial risk.\n\n**Impact:** Severe legal and financial repercussions, including potential criminal liability for the company and its officers, fines, seizure of assets, and reputational damage. Any transaction using stablecoins would be illegal.\n\n**Recommendation:** Immediately draft and implement a comprehensive policy explicitly prohibiting the acquisition, holding, transfer, or use of stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies for any company business or on company systems. The policy must be communicated to all employees and integrated into the compliance training program.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Companies must adhere to foreign exchange controls governed by Bangladesh Bank. All cross-border transactions require authorization and must flow through official banking channels.\n\n**Current Status:** No policy exists that prohibits using stablecoins to circumvent FX controls for international payments or settlements.\n\n**Gap:** A critical control gap exists where employees or agents could potentially use stablecoins to make or receive international payments, bypassing official banking channels and violating FX regulations.\n\n**Impact:** Breach of foreign exchange regulations could result in heavy fines, legal action, loss of foreign exchange operating licenses (if applicable), and restrictions on future international business.\n\n**Recommendation:** Integrate a specific clause into the company's Treasury and Payments Policy strictly mandating that all cross-border transactions must be executed through authorized dealer banks. Explicitly prohibit the use of any digital or crypto-assets for value transfer across borders. Implement dual controls and mandatory documentation for all international payments.\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Financial transactions must comply with the Money Laundering Prevention Act (MLPA), 2012, requiring KYC, record-keeping, and suspicious transaction reporting to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU).\n\n**Recommendation:** Amend the company's AML/CFT policy to explicitly include stablecoins and other virtual assets as prohibited mediums of exchange. Update customer and employee due diligence processes to screen for and inquire about crypto-asset usage. Implement transaction monitoring rules to flag potential circumvention attempts.\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **Prohibition on Stablecoin Usage**: not_met\n❌ **AML/CFT Controls for Digital Assets**: not_met\n❌ **Adherence to FX Controls via Official Channels**: not_met\n❌ **Monitoring of Regulatory Developments**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update Summary\nGenerated: 2026-01-30T18:36:22.156293\n\n## Overview\nThis document summarizes proposed updates to company policies and standards based on regulatory gap analysis.\n\n## New Policies Required\n\n## Modified Policies\n\n### GAP-001\n**Category:** Compliance\n**Current Policy:** No company policy exists regarding the use, holding, or transaction of stablecoins.\n**Proposed Change:** Immediately draft and implement a comprehensive policy explicitly prohibiting the acquisition, holding, transfer, or use of stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies for any company business or on company systems. The policy must be communicated to all employees and integrated into the compliance training program.\n\n### GAP-002\n**Category:** AML/KYC\n**Current Policy:** No specific policy linking AML/CFT procedures to digital asset or stablecoin risks.\n**Proposed Change:** Amend the company's AML/CFT policy to explicitly include stablecoins and other virtual assets as prohibited mediums of exchange. Update customer and employee due diligence processes to screen for and inquire about crypto-asset usage. Implement transaction monitoring rules to flag potential circumvention attempts.\n\n### GAP-003\n**Category:** Compliance\n**Current Policy:** No policy exists that prohibits using stablecoins to circumvent FX controls for international payments or settlements.\n**Proposed Change:** Integrate a specific clause into the company's Treasury and Payments Policy strictly mandating that all cross-border transactions must be executed through authorized dealer banks. Explicitly prohibit the use of any digital or crypto-assets for value transfer across borders. Implement dual controls and mandatory documentation for all international payments.\n\n### GAP-004\n**Category:** Compliance\n**Current Policy:** No process for monitoring regulatory developments in digital assets, both in Bangladesh and in jurisdictions where the company operates.\n**Proposed Change:** Assign responsibility (e.g., Legal or Compliance department) to monitor announcements from Bangladesh Bank, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and international standard-setters (like FATF) regarding digital assets. Establish a quarterly review process to assess the regulatory landscape and update policies accordingly.\n\n\n\n## Policy Implementation\n\n✅ **Automatically implemented 4 policies**\n\n📁 **Saved to:** C:\\Users\\takun\\Desktop\\Regulatory_Policies\n\n📄 **Summary file:** C:\\Users\\takun\\Desktop\\Regulatory_Policies\\IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md\n\n\n### Implemented Policies:\n\n- **GAP-001** (Compliance) - Compliance_GAP-001.md\n\n- **GAP-002** (AML/KYC) - AML_KYC_GAP-002.md\n\n- **GAP-003** (Compliance) - Compliance_GAP-003.md\n\n- **GAP-004** (Compliance) - Compliance_GAP-004.md\n\n\n"
