# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-11T20:53:26.574313

## Executive Summary
Overall compliance status is NON-COMPLIANT. The analysis reveals a fundamental and critical absence of any documented policies or frameworks necessary to operate a stablecoin service in Jersey. The company is exposed to severe legal, financial, and reputational risks. Immediate action is required to: 1) Halt any Jersey-facing operations, 2) Engage with the JFSC, and 3) Develop a complete compliance program from the ground up before seeking authorization. All identified gaps are Critical or High priority due to the total lack of foundational controls.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Jersey's regulatory framework for stablecoins requires authorization under the Financial Services (Jersey) Law 1998 for issuance, custody, or exchange activities. This includes requirements for governance, risk management, capital adequacy, and consumer protection.

**Current Status:** No company policies provided for analysis. This indicates a complete absence of documented policies, procedures, or controls related to stablecoin operations in Jersey.

**Gap:** Complete absence of a documented compliance framework. The company lacks any policies addressing authorization requirements, governance structures, risk management, capital, consumer protection, or operational standards mandated for stablecoin activities in Jersey.

**Impact:** Operating without authorization is illegal and carries severe penalties, including fines, license revocation, and criminal liability for directors. It exposes the company to immediate regulatory enforcement action, reputational destruction, and loss of customer trust.

**Recommendation:** 1. Immediately cease any stablecoin-related activities in/into Jersey until compliance is established. 2. Engage with the Jersey Financial Services Commission (JFSC) to understand the specific authorization pathway (e.g., as a Money Service Business, Digital Asset Service Provider). 3. Develop a comprehensive compliance policy framework covering governance, risk management, capital, custody, redemption, disclosures, and AML/CFT before applying for authorization.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Adherence to Jersey's Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) regime, primarily the Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999 and the Money Laundering (Jersey) Order 2008. This requires robust Customer Due Diligence (CDD), transaction monitoring, reporting of suspicious activity, and record-keeping.

**Current Status:** No AML/CFT policies or procedures documented.

**Gap:** No framework exists to identify customers, monitor transactions, report suspicious activity, or maintain required records. This is a fundamental failure for any financial service in Jersey.

**Impact:** High risk of facilitating money laundering or terrorist financing. Will result in significant regulatory sanctions, potential criminal prosecution, and inability to establish banking relationships.

**Recommendation:** Develop and implement a Jersey-specific AML/CFT Policy and Procedures Manual. Appoint a Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO) and a Money Laundering Compliance Officer (MLCO). Integrate CDD/KYC processes, risk-based transaction monitoring systems, and clear reporting lines to the JFSC and Jersey's Financial Intelligence Unit.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Requirement for clear, fair, and non-misleading disclosures to consumers regarding the nature of the stablecoin, its stabilization mechanism, associated risks, redemption rights, and fees.

**Recommendation:** Create comprehensive disclosure documents and marketing standards that clearly explain: the stabilization mechanism (e.g., fiat-backed, algorithmic), custody arrangements, redemption process, all risks (e.g., de-pegging, counterparty, regulatory), and all fees. Ensure these are presented to customers prior to transaction.

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Prudential requirements, including capital adequacy and liquidity management, to ensure the entity can meet its obligations, particularly redemption requests.

**Recommendation:** Develop a Capital Adequacy and Liquidity Management Policy. Define and implement a risk-based capital requirement. For fiat-backed stablecoins, ensure a 1:1 liquid asset reserve (or as per JFSC specification) held with a regulated custodian, with frequent attestations or audits.

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Governance and risk management frameworks, including defined roles and responsibilities for the Board, senior management, and compliance functions.

**Recommendation:** Establish a formal Governance Framework document outlining Board composition, committees, and duties. Develop a Risk Management Framework that includes a risk taxonomy, assessment methodology, and mitigation strategies. Formally appoint a Head of Compliance with direct reporting lines to the Board.

### Gap 4: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Operational resilience and technology risk management, including cybersecurity measures, custody solutions for reserve assets, and business continuity planning.

**Recommendation:** Implement a Cybersecurity Policy aligned with standards like ISO 27001 or NIST. Establish a robust Custody Policy for reserve assets, preferably using regulated third-party custodians. Develop and test a Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plan.
