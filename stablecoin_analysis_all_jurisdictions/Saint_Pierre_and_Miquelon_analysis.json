Policy Title  \n**Stablecoin Issuance and Operations Compliance Policy for Saint Pierre and Miquelon**\n\n## 2. Purpose and Scope  \n**Purpose:**  \nThis policy establishes a formal framework to ensure that any stablecoin issuance or operational activities conducted by or on behalf of our organization within the jurisdiction of Saint Pierre and Miquelon (SPM) are fully compliant with applicable regulatory requirements. The policy aims to mitigate legal, financial, and reputational risks by mandating rigorous regulatory research, licensing adherence, and ongoing operational compliance.\n\n**Scope:**  \nThis policy applies to all employees, contractors, subsidiaries, and third-party service providers engaged in or supporting activities related to the issuance, distribution, redemption, marketing, or operational management of stablecoins (as defined herein) within or targeting the SPM jurisdiction. It covers all phases from initial research and licensing to ongoing operations and reporting.\n\n## 3. Definitions  \n- **Stablecoin:** A type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified asset or a pool of assets (e.g., fiat currencies like the Euro, commodities, or other cryptocurrencies).\n- **Issuance:** The act of creating and distributing stablecoins to holders.\n- **Financial Authorities (SPM):** The relevant regulatory bodies governing financial services in Saint Pierre and Miquelon. Given SPM’s status as a French overseas collectivity, this includes authorities operating under French and European Union (EU) supervisory frameworks, notably the **Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution (ACPR)** and the **Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF)**, in coordination with EU regulations (e.g., Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation - MiCA).\n- **Licensing/Authorization:** Formal approval granted by the SPM financial authorities permitting an entity to conduct specific stablecoin-related activities.\n- **Regulatory Research:** The systematic process of identifying, analyzing, and interpreting laws, regulations, guidelines, and supervisory expectations applicable to stablecoin operations in SPM.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement  \nIt is the policy of this organization that **no stablecoin issuance or operational activity shall be conducted within or targeting the Saint Pierre and Miquelon jurisdiction without first:**  \na) Conducting comprehensive, counsel-guided regulatory research to identify all applicable requirements.  \nb) Securing all necessary licenses or authorizations from the relevant SPM financial authorities.  \nc) Implementing and maintaining a documented compliance framework that meets or exceeds all jurisdictional standards for operational conduct, consumer protection, prudential management, and transparency.\n\nNon-compliance with this policy is strictly prohibited and may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contracts, and legal prosecution.\n\n## 5. Procedures  \nTo implement this policy, the following procedures must be followed:\n\n**Phase 1: Regulatory Research & Analysis**  \n1. **Engagement of Counsel:** The Compliance Department must retain qualified local legal counsel in Saint Pierre and Miquelon with expertise in French/EU financial and crypto-asset regulation.  \n2. **Research Mandate:** Counsel will be tasked with delivering a comprehensive memorandum detailing:  \n   - The specific licensing/authorization regime for stablecoin issuers and service providers in SPM.  \n   - Applicable French national laws and EU regulations (e.g., MiCA, AML/CFT directives).  \n   - Operational requirements (reserve management, redemption rights, governance, technology standards).  \n   - Ongoing reporting and disclosure obligations to authorities.  \n3. **Internal Review:** Findings will be presented to the Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) and senior management to guide decision-making.\n\n**Phase 2: Policy Framework Development & Licensing**  \n1. **Drafting:** Based on the research, the Compliance Department will draft a **Jurisdiction-Specific Stablecoin Operations Framework** document. This document will address:  \n   - Licensing Application Procedures: Steps, documentation, and timelines for applying to SPM authorities.  \n   - Operational Standards: Detailed protocols for reserve asset management (composition, custody, audit), issuance/redemption mechanics, cybersecurity, and consumer complaint handling.  \n   - Reporting Obligations: Schedules and templates for prudential reports, transaction reports, and significant incident disclosures.  \n2. **Approval & Submission:** The finalized Framework and license application must be approved by the Executive Committee before submission to regulators.\n\n**Phase 3: Implementation & Ongoing Operations**  \n1. **Training:** All relevant personnel must be trained on the SPM-specific Framework and their compliance responsibilities.  \n2. **Launch:** Operational activities may commence only upon receipt of formal written authorization from the SPM financial authorities.  \n3. **Monitoring:** The Compliance Department will continuously monitor operations against the Framework and regulatory changes.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements  \n- **Mandatory Licensing:** Operating without a required license is a fundamental violation.  \n- **Adherence to Framework:** All operational decisions must align with the approved Jurisdiction-Specific Stablecoin Operations Framework.  \n- **Record Keeping:** Maintain all records related to licensing, transactions, reserve audits, and compliance reports for a minimum period as required by SPM law (anticipated minimum of 5-7 years under EU standards).  \n- **Reporting:** Submit all required reports to authorities accurately and by mandated deadlines. Any material adverse events (e.g., failure to maintain peg, custody breach) must be reported immediately per regulatory guidelines.  \n- **Audit:** Annual external audits of reserve assets and compliance with license conditions are required.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule  \nThis policy and its accompanying Jurisdiction-Specific Framework shall be reviewed:  \n- **Annually** by the Compliance Department.  \n- **Immediately** upon publication of any new or amended regulation from EU, French, or SPM authorities affecting stablecoins.  \n- Following any **material compliance incident**.  \nAll updates require re-approval by the Executive Committee.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements  \nThis policy is designed to ensure conformity with, but is not limited to, the following regulatory landscapes:  \n1. **European Union:** Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 on Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) – particularly Title III on \"Asset-Referenced Tokens\" (ARTs) and Title IV on \"E-money Tokens\" (EMTs).  \n2. **France:** French Monetary and Financial Code (Code monétaire et financier), as enforced by the ACPR and AMF, including PSAN (Digital Asset Service Provider) registration requirements pending MiCA full application.  \n3. **Saint Pierre and Miquelon:** Local ordinances and decrees implementing French/EU financial law within the territory.  \n4. **Cross-Cutting:** EU Anti-Money Laundering Directives (AMLD 5/6) and corresponding French legislation.\n\n*Policy Version: 1.0  \nEffective Date: [Date of Executive Committee Approval]  \nApproved By: [Name/Title of Approving Officer]*\n```"

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Saint Pierre and Miquelon\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-02-12T16:21:29.370509\n\n## Executive Summary\nCRITICAL COMPLIANCE GAPS IDENTIFIED. The company currently has no documented policies addressing stablecoin regulatory requirements for Saint Pierre and Miquelon jurisdiction. All fundamental regulatory requirements appear unmet based on available information. Immediate action is required to: 1) Conduct proper regulatory research through local legal counsel, 2) Develop comprehensive policy framework addressing licensing, reserves, AML/CFT, consumer protection, and operational risks, 3) Establish governance structures for ongoing compliance monitoring. The company should consider suspending any stablecoin operations in this jurisdiction until basic compliance frameworks are established to avoid severe regulatory consequences.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance and operation require specific licensing or authorization from financial authorities in Saint Pierre and Miquelon (likely under French/EU regulatory framework).\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy exists regarding stablecoin operations in Saint Pierre and Miquelon jurisdiction.\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing stablecoin regulatory requirements for this specific jurisdiction.\n\n**Impact:** Potential for regulatory enforcement actions, fines, license revocation, and reputational damage if operating without proper authorization.\n\n**Recommendation:** 1. Conduct comprehensive regulatory research on stablecoin regulations in Saint Pierre and Miquelon (consult local legal counsel). 2. Develop jurisdiction-specific policy framework addressing licensing requirements, operational standards, and reporting obligations.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must maintain adequate reserves (likely 100% backing) with regular independent audits and public disclosure.\n\n**Current Status:** No reserve management or audit policies documented for stablecoin operations.\n\n**Gap:** Missing policies governing reserve composition, custody, audit frequency, and public disclosure requirements.\n\n**Impact:** Risk of regulatory sanctions for insufficient reserves, loss of consumer confidence, and potential insolvency events.\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive reserve management policy including: asset composition requirements, custody arrangements, monthly/quarterly attestation requirements, and public disclosure protocols.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting (aligned with French/EU AML directives).\n\n**Current Status:** No specific AML/CFT policies for stablecoin operations in this jurisdiction.\n\n**Gap:** Lack of jurisdiction-specific AML/CFT procedures for stablecoin transactions and customer onboarding.\n\n**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties for AML/CFT violations, potential criminal liability, and loss of banking relationships.\n\n**Recommendation:** Create AML/CFT policy specific to stablecoin operations including: risk assessment methodology, customer identification procedures, transaction monitoring thresholds, and reporting mechanisms to local authorities.\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including clear disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling procedures.\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop consumer protection policy covering: clear risk disclosures, redemption procedures and timelines, complaint handling process, and dispute resolution mechanisms.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Operational risk management including cybersecurity, business continuity, and technology governance.\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish operational risk framework specific to stablecoin operations including: smart contract audit requirements, cybersecurity standards, key management protocols, and business continuity planning.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-006\n**Requirement:** Regular regulatory reporting to local authorities (frequency and content unspecified due to research limitations).\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop regulatory reporting policy after determining specific requirements through local legal consultation. Include reporting schedules, content requirements, and responsible parties.\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **licensing_authorization**: not_met\n❌ **reserve_requirements**: not_met\n❌ **aml_cft_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **consumer_protection**: not_met\n❌ **operational_risk**: not_met\n❌ **regulatory_reporting**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update Summary\nGenerated: 2026-02-12T16:22:15.197260\n\n## Overview\nThis document summarizes proposed updates to company policies and standards based on regulatory gap analysis.\n\n## New Policies Required\n\n## Modified Policies\n\n### GAP-001\n**Category:** Compliance\n**Current Policy:** No documented policy exists regarding stablecoin operations in Saint Pierre and Miquelon jurisdiction.\n**Proposed Change:** 1.
