# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T23:29:42.985743

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no documented policies addressing Ghana's regulatory requirements for stablecoin operations. All essential regulatory areas show complete non-compliance. Immediate action is required to: 1) Cease operations until licensing is secured 2) Develop comprehensive compliance framework 3) Engage with Bank of Ghana regulators. The company faces severe legal, financial, and reputational risks if these gaps are not addressed urgently. A phased remediation approach should prioritize licensing and AML/CFT compliance first, followed by consumer protection and operational resilience measures.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Legal authorization/licensing for stablecoin issuance or custody in Ghana (Bank of Ghana oversight)

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing licensing requirements for operating stablecoin services in Ghana

**Impact:** Legal prohibition of operations, regulatory enforcement actions, fines, and potential criminal liability

**Recommendation:** Immediately suspend operations until proper licensing is obtained. Develop licensing application strategy and engage with Bank of Ghana's Fintech and Innovation Office.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering/Combating Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) compliance per Ghana's Anti-Money Laundering Act, 2020 (Act 1044)

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** No AML/CFT framework, customer due diligence procedures, transaction monitoring, or suspicious activity reporting mechanisms

**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, loss of banking relationships, reputational damage, and potential criminal prosecution

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive AML/CFT program including: 1) Customer identification and verification procedures 2) Risk-based customer due diligence 3) Transaction monitoring system 4) Suspicious activity reporting protocols 5) Designated compliance officer appointment

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Consumer protection requirements including disclosure, transparency, and complaint handling

**Recommendation:** Implement consumer protection policy covering: 1) Clear terms of service 2) Risk disclosures 3) Fee transparency 4) Complaint handling procedures 5) Data protection measures

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Capital adequacy and reserve requirements for stablecoin issuers

**Recommendation:** Establish reserve management policy requiring: 1) Full backing of stablecoins with high-quality liquid assets 2) Regular independent audits 3) Public attestations 4) Clear redemption procedures

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Cybersecurity and operational resilience requirements

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive cybersecurity program including: 1) Security controls and encryption standards 2) Incident response plan 3) Business continuity planning 4) Regular security testing and audits
