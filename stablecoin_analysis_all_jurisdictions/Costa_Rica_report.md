# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T21:05:06.156728

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits a complete absence of documented policies and procedures necessary for stablecoin operations in Costa Rica. All fundamental regulatory requirements are unmet, representing critical compliance deficiencies. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive compliance framework before any operational activities can commence. The most urgent priorities are obtaining regulatory authorization and implementing AML controls. Given Costa Rica's evolving regulatory landscape for digital assets, the company should also establish ongoing regulatory monitoring to address emerging requirements.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance requires authorization from Costa Rican financial regulator (SUGEF or similar authority)

**Current Status:** No documented policy for regulatory authorization or licensing

**Gap:** Company lacks policies for obtaining necessary regulatory approvals to issue or operate stablecoin services in Costa Rica

**Impact:** Legal prohibition of operations, potential fines, criminal liability for unauthorized financial activities

**Recommendation:** Develop regulatory engagement strategy and licensing application process; suspend operations until authorization obtained

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and reporting

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT policies or procedures

**Gap:** Complete absence of AML framework required for financial service providers

**Impact:** Severe regulatory sanctions, loss of banking relationships, reputational damage

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive AML program including KYC procedures, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and designated compliance officer

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including disclosure requirements, complaint handling, and reserve backing transparency

**Recommendation:** Develop consumer protection framework including clear disclosures, reserve audit requirements, and formal complaint resolution process

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Capital adequacy and reserve requirements for stablecoin issuers

**Recommendation:** Establish reserve management policy with 1:1 backing requirement, independent custody, and regular third-party audits

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity standards

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive cybersecurity program including penetration testing, incident response plan, and business continuity planning
