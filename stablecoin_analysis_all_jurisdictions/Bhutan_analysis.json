AML/CTF policies specific to stablecoin operations\n\n**Gap:** Lack of customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and record-keeping procedures\n\n**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, loss of banking relationships, and potential criminal liability for money laundering violations\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive AML/CTF program including KYC procedures, transaction monitoring, and SAR filing protocols\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Reserve management and backing requirements for stablecoins\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive reserve management policies including asset composition requirements, custody standards, and audit procedures\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements\n\n**Recommendation:** Create consumer protection framework including clear disclosures, redemption policies, and complaint resolution procedures\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-006\n**Requirement:** Cybersecurity and operational resilience standards\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish cybersecurity framework including access controls, incident response plans, and regular security assessments\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **legal_framework_requirements**: not_met\n❌ **licensing_requirements**: not_met\n❌ **reserve_management**:
