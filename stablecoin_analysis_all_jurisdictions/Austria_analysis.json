The Strategy Document requires approval by the Global Chief Compliance Officer and the Executive Board.\n\n### Phase 3: Engagement and Application (Post-Strategy Approval)\n1.  Execute the Regulatory Engagement Plan to initiate formal dialogue with the FMA.\n2.  Prepare and submit the complete authorization application package as per the FMA's specifications and the internal Strategy Document.\n3.  Design and implement the required compliance infrastructure in parallel with the application review process.\n\n### Phase 4: Post-Authorization\n1.  Upon receiving FMA authorization, the Compliance department will lift the suspension for the specifically approved activities.\n2.  Ongoing compliance will be managed as per the established framework and reported regularly to the FMA and internal governance bodies.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n*   **Adherence to Suspension:** All employees and contractors must comply strictly with the immediate suspension order. Any violation will be subject to disciplinary action.\n*   **Cooperation with Strategy Development:** All business units must provide full cooperation and necessary information to the project team developing the Licensing Strategy Document.\n*   **Future Compliance:** Once authorized, all operations must adhere continuously to:\n    *   The terms and conditions of the FMA authorization.\n    *   All applicable Austrian laws, including the Financial Market Anti-Money Laundering Act (FM-GwG) and the upcoming national implementation of the EU MiCA Regulation.\n    *   The organization's internal compliance policies and procedures.\n*   **Reporting:** Any suspected or actual breaches of this policy, or any regulatory inquiries, must be reported immediately to the Head of Compliance (Austria).\n\n## 7.

References to Regulatory Requirements\nThis policy is formulated in response to and in anticipation of the following regulatory landscape:\n*   **Primary Authority:** Austrian Financial Market Authority (FMA) supervisory mandate and authorization powers.\n*   **EU Regulation:** Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 on Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) – specifically Title III on \"Asset-Referenced Tokens\" and Title IV on \"E-money Tokens\".\n*   **National Law:** Relevant provisions of the Austrian Banking Act (BWG), Payment Services Act (ZaDiG), and Financial Market Anti-Money Laundering Act (FM-GwG).\n*   **FMA Guidance:** Any existing and future official communications, guidance notes, or position papers issued by the FMA regarding crypto-assets and stablecoins.\n\n---\n**Policy Effective Date:** [Date of Publication]\n**Policy Owner:** Head of Compliance (Austria)\n**Approved By:** [Name/Title of Approving Executive]\n```"

Purpose and Scope\n### 2.1 Purpose\nThis policy establishes comprehensive requirements for capital adequacy, reserve backing, and liquidity management for all stablecoins issued by [Company Name] (\"the Issuer\") in compliance with the EU Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA). The policy ensures that issued stablecoins are fully backed by high-quality reserve assets, that the Issuer maintains sufficient capital to absorb losses, and that all operations meet the highest standards of security, transparency, and regulatory compliance.\n\n### 2.2 Scope\nThis policy applies to:\n*   All departments and personnel involved in the issuance, management, and redemption of stablecoins.\n*   All activities related to the composition, custody, and auditing of the reserve portfolio.\n*   All third-party service providers, including custodians and auditors, engaged in reserve management activities.\n*   All stablecoin products issued by the Issuer that are classified as \"asset-referenced tokens\" or \"e-money tokens\" under MiCA.\n\n## 3. Definitions\n*   **Asset-Referenced Token (ART):** A type of crypto-asset that purports to maintain a stable value by referencing multiple fiat currencies, commodities, or crypto-assets.\n*   **E-Money Token (EMT):** A type of crypto-asset that purports to maintain a stable value by referencing a single fiat currency.\n*   **Reserve Assets:** The pool of low-risk, highly liquid assets held to fully back the outstanding stablecoins in circulation.\n*   **Liquidity Requirement:** The obligation to ensure that a sufficient proportion of reserve assets can be converted to fiat currency to meet expected redemption requests without significant loss.\n*   **Own Funds:** The Issuer's capital, as defined by MiCA, which must be held separately from reserve assets to cover operational risks.\n*   **Competent Authority:** The relevant national authority designated to supervise compliance with MiCA (e.g., BaFin in Germany, AMF in France).\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\n[Company Name] is committed to operating with the highest degree of integrity and financial prudence. We mandate that:\n1.  All issued stablecoins must be fully backed at all times by a dedicated reserve of high-quality, low-risk assets.\n2.  The Issuer must maintain permanent \"own funds\" (capital) at or above the higher of: (a) EUR 350,000, or (b) 2% of the average amount of the reserve assets.\n3.  The management of reserve assets must prioritize safety, liquidity, and transparency above yield generation.\n4.  Reserve assets must be held in segregated accounts with regulated custodians.\n5.  The reserve composition and value must be subject to monthly internal reconciliation and quarterly independent audits.\n6.  Clear procedures must be established to manage liquidity events and ensure timely redemption for stablecoin holders.\n\n## 5. Procedures\n### 5.1 Minimum Capital Requirements (\"Own Funds\")\n*   The Treasury Department shall calculate the required level of own funds on the last day of each month.\n*   The calculation shall be based on the average amount of reserve assets over the preceding six months.\n*   Own funds must be maintained in liquid form (cash or cash equivalents) and held separately from the reserve assets on the Issuer's balance sheet.\n*   Any shortfall against the requirement must be remedied within 10 business days through a capital injection.\n\n### 5.2 Reserve Asset Composition\n*   The reserve portfolio shall be composed exclusively of the following **Permissible Assets**:\n    *   Cash deposits held in credit institutions authorized in the EU.\n    *   Sovereign debt securities issued by EU Member States with a credit assessment of at least 1 (ECB classification).\n    *   Short-term debt instruments (e.g., commercial paper) with a maximum residual maturity of 12 months and a minimum credit quality of A-1/P-1/F1.\n    *   Sovereign money market fund shares denominated in the referenced currency.\n*   **Concentration Limits:** No more than 5% of the total reserve value may be held in securities from a single issuer (excluding EU sovereign debt and cash deposits in ECB-approved institutions).\n*   **Liquidity Buffer:** A minimum of 10% of the reserve must be held in cash or overnight deposits to meet immediate redemption requests.\n\n### 5.3 Custody Arrangements\n*   All reserve assets must be held in custody with a **Regulated Custodian** (a credit institution or a crypto-asset service provider authorized for custody under MiCA).\n*   Custody agreements must explicitly state that assets are held for the benefit of stablecoin holders, are segregated from the custodian's own assets and the Issuer's operating accounts, and are protected in the event of the custodian's insolvency.\n*   The Issuer must maintain a documented due diligence process for selecting and periodically reviewing all custodians.\n\n### 5.4 Independent Audit and Reporting\n*   An independent external auditor, registered with the EU Competent Authority, must perform a quarterly attestation of the reserve.\n*   The audit must verify: (1) the existence and ownership of reserve assets, (2) the 1:1 backing of all stablecoins in circulation, and (3) compliance with the composition rules in Section 5.2.\n*   A detailed report of the reserve composition and audit opinion must be published on the Issuer's website within 20 business days of each quarter's end.\n\n### 5.5 Liquidity Management Procedures\n*   The Treasury Department shall conduct weekly stress tests to model redemption scenarios.\n*   A **Liquidity Contingency Plan** shall be maintained, outlining steps to liquidate non-cash reserve assets in an orderly manner to meet elevated redemption demand, including predefined counterparties and trading venues.\n*   Redemption requests from holders shall be processed within two (2) business days for standard requests, as per MiCA requirements.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n*   The Chief Financial Officer (CFO) is the policy owner and is ultimately responsible for compliance.\n*   The Treasury Department is responsible for day-to-day implementation, record-keeping, and internal reporting.\n*   Non-compliance with this policy may result in disciplinary action, regulatory penalties, and reputational damage. Any breach must be reported immediately to the CFO and the Compliance Department.\n*   The Issuer must notify the Competent Authority of any material changes to the reserve management policy or any failure to meet the capital or reserve requirements.\n\n## 7.

Purpose and Scope\n### 2.1 Purpose\nThis policy establishes comprehensive requirements for capital adequacy, reserve backing, and liquidity management for all stablecoins issued by [Company Name] (\"the Issuer\") in compliance with the EU Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA). The policy ensures that issued stablecoins are fully backed by high-quality reserve assets, that the Issuer maintains sufficient capital to absorb losses, and that all operations meet the highest standards of security, transparency, and regulatory compliance.\n\n### 2.2 Scope\nThis policy applies to:\n*   All departments and personnel involved in the issuance, management, and redemption of stablecoins.\n*   All activities related to the composition, custody, and auditing of the reserve portfolio.\n*   All third-party service providers, including custodians and auditors, engaged in reserve management activities.\n*   All stablecoin products issued by the Issuer that are classified as \"asset-referenced tokens\" or \"e-money tokens\" under MiCA.\n\n## 3. Definitions\n*   **Asset-Referenced Token (ART):** A type of crypto-asset that purports to maintain a stable value by referencing multiple fiat currencies, commodities, or crypto-assets.\n*   **E-Money Token (EMT):** A type of crypto-asset that purports to maintain a stable value by referencing a single fiat currency.\n*   **Reserve Assets:** The pool of low-risk, highly liquid assets held to fully back the outstanding stablecoins in circulation.\n*   **Liquidity Requirement:** The obligation to ensure that a sufficient proportion of reserve assets can be converted to fiat currency to meet expected redemption requests without significant loss.\n*   **Own Funds:** The Issuer's capital, as defined by MiCA, which must be held separately from reserve assets to cover operational risks.\n*   **Competent Authority:** The relevant national authority designated to supervise compliance with MiCA (e.g., BaFin in Germany, AMF in France).\n\n## 4.

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Austria\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-01-30T06:00:53.400593\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company exhibits a complete absence of documented policies and procedures necessary for compliant stablecoin operations in Austria. All critical regulatory requirements under Austrian FMA oversight and EU MiCA regulation are unmet. The current state represents significant regulatory risk, with immediate action required to develop foundational compliance frameworks before any operational activities can proceed. Priority should be given to establishing basic governance, AML/CTF controls, and engagement with regulators to understand authorization requirements. The company is currently non-compliant with all material regulatory obligations and should not engage in stablecoin issuance activities until these gaps are addressed.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Authorization requirement for issuing stablecoins under Austrian Financial Market Authority (FMA) oversight\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found\n\n**Gap:** Company lacks any documented policy or procedure for obtaining necessary authorization to issue stablecoins in Austria. No evidence of engagement with FMA or understanding of licensing requirements.\n\n**Impact:** Operating without proper authorization could result in enforcement actions, fines, license revocation, and reputational damage. May constitute illegal financial activity.\n\n**Recommendation:** Immediately suspend any stablecoin issuance activities in Austria until proper authorization is obtained. Develop a comprehensive licensing strategy document outlining steps to engage with FMA, application requirements, and compliance framework.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Capital requirements and reserve backing for stablecoin issuers as per EU Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found\n\n**Gap:** No policies exist regarding capital adequacy, reserve management, or asset backing for stablecoins. No documentation of reserve composition, custody arrangements, or audit procedures.\n\n**Impact:** Failure to maintain adequate reserves could lead to insolvency, loss of peg, consumer harm, and regulatory sanctions. Violation of MiCA requirements could result in significant penalties.\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop and implement a comprehensive reserve management policy specifying: 1) Minimum capital requirements, 2) Acceptable reserve assets and their composition, 3) Custody arrangements with regulated entities, 4) Regular independent audits, 5) Liquidity management procedures.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance under Austrian Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and EU AMLD6\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of AML/CTF policies, procedures, or controls. No evidence of customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, or employee training programs.\n\n**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, potential criminal liability for management, loss of banking relationships, and inclusion in enforcement actions. Could trigger immediate supervisory intervention.\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive AML/CTF program including: 1) Customer identification and verification procedures (KYC), 2) Risk-based transaction monitoring system, 3) Suspicious activity reporting procedures to Austrian FIU, 4) Regular employee training, 5) Appointment of AML compliance officer, 6) Record-keeping policies.\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including redemption rights, disclosures, and complaint handling\n\n**Recommendation:** Create consumer protection framework including: 1) Clear redemption policy with timelines and procedures, 2) Comprehensive fee disclosure documents, 3) Complaint handling procedures with escalation paths, 4) User agreements compliant with Austrian consumer law, 5) Risk disclosure statements.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity requirements for financial service providers\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop operational resilience framework including: 1) Cybersecurity policy with technical controls, 2) Business continuity and disaster recovery plans, 3) Incident response procedures, 4) Third-party risk management for service providers, 5) Regular security testing and audits.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-006\n**Requirement:** Governance and risk management framework requirements for financial institutions\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish formal governance framework including: 1) Clear organizational structure with defined roles and responsibilities, 2) Independent compliance function, 3) Risk management committee, 4) Internal audit function, 5) Whistleblower protection program, 6) Regular board reporting on compliance matters.\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **authorization_licensing**: not_met\n❌ **capital_reserves**: not_met\n❌ **consumer_protection**: not_met\n❌ **aml_ctf_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **operational_resilience**: not_met\n❌ **governance_risk_management**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update Summary\nGenerated: 2026-01-30T06:01:36.801663\n\n## Overview\nThis document summarizes proposed updates to company policies and standards based on regulatory gap analysis.\n\n## New Policies Required\n\n## Modified Policies\n\n### GAP-001\n**Category:** Compliance\n**Current Policy:** No documented policy found\n**Proposed Change:** Immediately suspend any stablecoin issuance activities in Austria until proper authorization is obtained.
