# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-06T00:23:00.247408

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no documented policies addressing Luxembourg's stablecoin regulatory framework. This represents a complete regulatory gap that prevents any lawful stablecoin operations in Luxembourg. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive compliance program before considering any market entry or operations. The most critical gaps relate to authorization requirements, reserve management, and redemption rights under MiCA and CSSF regulations. The company should prioritize engaging legal counsel specializing in Luxembourg financial regulation and developing foundational policies before any operational activities.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Authorization requirement for issuing stablecoins (CSSF Circular 22/806 and upcoming MiCA framework)

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing authorization requirements for stablecoin issuance or service provision in Luxembourg

**Impact:** Legal prohibition from operating, potential enforcement actions, fines, and reputational damage

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive authorization policy outlining application requirements, capital requirements, governance standards, and risk management frameworks required by CSSF

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Reserve asset management and segregation requirements (MiCA Article 31-36)

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** No policies governing reserve composition, custody, segregation, or audit requirements for stablecoin reserves

**Impact:** Inability to demonstrate asset-backed stability, potential consumer harm, regulatory sanctions, and loss of market confidence

**Recommendation:** Establish reserve management policy specifying eligible assets, custody arrangements, segregation requirements, and independent audit procedures

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Redemption rights and procedures (MiCA Article 47)

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** No policies ensuring holders' right to redeem stablecoins at par value under normal and stressed conditions

**Impact:** Violation of consumer protection requirements, potential legal liability, and loss of user trust

**Recommendation:** Implement redemption policy with clear procedures, timelines, fees (if any), and stress scenario protocols

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Governance and risk management frameworks (CSSF Circular 22/806)

**Recommendation:** Develop governance framework with clear roles/responsibilities, risk appetite statement, three lines of defense model, and regular board reporting

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance (Luxembourg AML Law and CSSF requirements)

**Recommendation:** Create stablecoin-specific AML/CFT policy addressing wallet screening, transaction monitoring, KYC/CDD procedures, and suspicious activity reporting

### Gap 3: GAP-007
**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity (CSSF requirements and DORA)

**Recommendation:** Implement operational resilience framework with cybersecurity controls, BCP/DR plans, incident response procedures, and third-party risk management
