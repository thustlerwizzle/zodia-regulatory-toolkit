# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T18:45:21.826869

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no documented policies addressing Belarusian stablecoin regulations. Based on available information and general regulatory knowledge, all core regulatory requirements appear unmet. The company is operating in a high-risk compliance vacuum with potential for severe legal, financial, and reputational consequences. Immediate action is required to: 1) Suspend Belarus operations until regulatory clarity is obtained, 2) Conduct comprehensive regulatory research with local counsel, 3) Develop and implement a complete compliance framework before resuming operations. The absence of any documented policies suggests either complete lack of regulatory awareness or failure to document compliance efforts, both representing critical governance failures.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Legal authorization and licensing for stablecoin issuance and operations in Belarus

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing Belarusian regulatory requirements for stablecoin operations, including licensing, registration, and authorization procedures

**Impact:** Legal prohibition of operations, potential criminal liability, fines, and complete business shutdown in Belarus

**Recommendation:** Immediately suspend Belarus operations until comprehensive regulatory analysis is completed. Engage Belarusian legal counsel to determine applicable licensing requirements under the Digital Economy Development Ordinance and National Bank regulations.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Reserve requirements and asset backing for stablecoins

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** No policies governing reserve composition, custody, auditing, or transparency requirements for stablecoin backing assets

**Impact:** Regulatory enforcement actions, loss of consumer trust, potential fraud allegations, and financial penalties

**Recommendation:** Develop and implement a comprehensive reserve management policy specifying: 1) Eligible reserve assets, 2) Custody arrangements with regulated institutions, 3) Regular independent audits, 4) Public disclosure requirements

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance for stablecoin transactions

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** No anti-money laundering or counter-terrorist financing policies specific to stablecoin operations in Belarus

**Impact:** Severe regulatory sanctions, criminal prosecution, reputational damage, and exclusion from financial systems

**Recommendation:** Implement Belarus-specific AML/CFT program including: 1) Customer due diligence procedures, 2) Transaction monitoring systems, 3) Suspicious activity reporting to Belarusian financial intelligence unit, 4) Record-keeping requirements per local regulations

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements

**Recommendation:** Create consumer protection framework including: 1) Clear terms of service in Russian/Belarusian, 2) Risk disclosure statements, 3) Redemption guarantee policies, 4) Complaint resolution procedures compliant with Belarusian consumer protection laws

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity

**Recommendation:** Develop operational risk management policy aligned with Belarusian National Bank requirements, including: 1) Cybersecurity standards, 2) Business continuity planning, 3) Incident reporting procedures to Belarusian authorities, 4) Third-party risk management

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Reporting and supervisory requirements

**Recommendation:** Establish regulatory reporting framework including: 1) Regular reporting schedules to National Bank of Belarus, 2) Designated compliance officer for Belarus operations, 3) Procedures for regulatory examinations, 4) Communication protocols with supervisory authorities
