# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-12T16:33:05.897502

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no documented policies addressing stablecoin regulation in French Guiana (subject to French/EU financial regulations). All essential regulatory requirements are unmet, creating severe legal, financial, and operational risks. Immediate action is required to suspend operations and develop comprehensive compliance framework before resuming any stablecoin-related activities. The absence of basic policies indicates fundamental non-compliance with financial regulations governing electronic money and payment services in the EU jurisdiction.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance and operation must comply with French/EU financial regulations (as French Guiana is an overseas department of France)

**Current Status:** No documented policies for stablecoin operations

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing stablecoin issuance, redemption, reserve management, or operational requirements

**Impact:** Potential regulatory enforcement actions, fines, license revocation, and criminal liability for operating without proper authorization

**Recommendation:** Immediately suspend stablecoin operations until comprehensive policies are developed and approved. Engage legal counsel specializing in EU financial regulations (MiCA, PSD2, AMLD5) to draft compliance framework.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Authorization/Licensing requirements for electronic money institutions or payment service providers

**Current Status:** No licensing or authorization policies documented

**Gap:** No procedures for obtaining necessary licenses from ACPR (French Prudential Supervision and Resolution Authority) or compliance with EU authorization regimes

**Impact:** Operating without required licenses constitutes illegal financial activity with severe penalties including business closure and executive liability

**Recommendation:** Conduct immediate regulatory licensing assessment. Develop licensing roadmap and interim compliance measures while applications are processed.

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance under EU directives

**Current Status:** No AML/CTF policies documented

**Gap:** Missing customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and record-keeping procedures required for financial institutions

**Impact:** Significant financial penalties, reputational damage, and potential criminal prosecution for AML/CTF violations

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive AML/CTF program including KYC procedures, transaction monitoring systems, and designated compliance officer appointment.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive consumer protection framework including clear risk disclosures, redemption policies, and complaint resolution procedures.

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Reserve management and transparency requirements for stablecoin issuers

**Recommendation:** Establish robust reserve management policy with qualified custodian arrangements, regular audits, and public attestation reports.

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity requirements

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive operational risk framework including cybersecurity controls, incident response plan, and regular penetration testing.
