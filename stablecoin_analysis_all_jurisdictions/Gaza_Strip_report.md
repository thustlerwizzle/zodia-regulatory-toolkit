# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-12T18:56:10.420141

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits critical compliance deficiencies with no established policies addressing stablecoin operations, particularly concerning high-risk jurisdictions like Gaza Strip. All regulatory requirements are currently unmet, creating severe legal, financial, and reputational risks. Immediate action is required to establish a comprehensive compliance framework, with highest priority given to sanctions compliance, AML/CTF, and geographic risk management. The absence of any documented policies suggests the company may be operating in violation of multiple regulatory regimes and international sanctions.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Compliance with international sanctions regimes (UN, OFAC, EU) prohibiting financial transactions with designated entities in Gaza Strip

**Current Status:** No specific policy addressing Gaza Strip or stablecoin transactions in conflict zones

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing sanctions compliance for stablecoin operations involving Gaza Strip entities

**Impact:** Severe legal and reputational risks including criminal penalties, regulatory enforcement actions, and loss of banking relationships

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive sanctions screening program with real-time OFAC/SDN list checks, geographic restrictions, and enhanced due diligence for Gaza-related transactions

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) requirements for virtual asset service providers (VASP)

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CTF policy for stablecoin operations

**Gap:** Missing AML/CTF framework specific to stablecoin transactions, including customer identification, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting

**Impact:** Regulatory enforcement, fines, and potential loss of VASP licensing eligibility in regulated jurisdictions

**Recommendation:** Develop and implement FATF-compliant AML/CTF program with risk-based approach, KYC procedures, and transaction monitoring systems

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Geographic risk assessment and restricted jurisdiction policies

**Current Status:** No geographic risk assessment or restricted jurisdiction list

**Gap:** Lack of systematic approach to identifying and managing risks associated with high-risk jurisdictions like Gaza Strip

**Impact:** Unintentional sanctions violations, regulatory enforcement, and facilitation of illicit finance

**Recommendation:** Create geographic risk assessment framework with prohibited and high-risk jurisdiction lists, enhanced due diligence for medium-risk areas

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Stablecoin reserve requirements and transparency obligations (emerging global standards)

**Recommendation:** Establish reserve management policy with independent custody, regular attestations/audits, and transparent public reporting

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements for digital assets

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive consumer protection policy including clear disclosures, redemption procedures, and complaint resolution mechanisms

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Cross-border payment regulations and reporting requirements

**Recommendation:** Develop cross-border transaction policy implementing FATF Travel Rule (Rule 16) and local cross-border payment regulations
