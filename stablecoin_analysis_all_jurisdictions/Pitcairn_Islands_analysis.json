Policy Title\nStablecoin Reserve Management, Custody, and Independent Audit Policy\n\n### 2. Purpose and Scope\n**2.1 Purpose**  \nThis policy establishes the mandatory framework for all issuers of stablecoins operating under the jurisdiction of the Pitcairn Islands Digital Currency Authority (PIDCA) to maintain adequate reserves, ensure secure custody of reserve assets, and undergo regular independent audits. The policy is designed to ensure stability, transparency, and consumer protection by guaranteeing that all issued stablecoins are fully backed 1:1 by high-quality reserve assets.\n\n**2.2 Scope**  \nThis policy applies to all entities licensed or seeking a license as a stablecoin issuer by PIDCA. It covers the management, composition, custody, reporting, and independent verification of all reserve assets backing issued stablecoin liabilities.\n\n### 3. Definitions\n*   **Approved Assets:** Asset classes explicitly permitted by PIDCA for inclusion in the reserve, as detailed in Section 5.1.\n*   **Custodian:** A regulated financial institution or qualified custodian meeting PIDCA standards, responsible for the safekeeping of reserve assets.\n*   **Issuer:** The licensed entity that creates and manages a stablecoin.\n*   **PIDCA:** The Pitcairn Islands Digital Currency Authority, the regulatory body governing digital assets.\n*   **Reserve:** The pool of assets held to fully back the outstanding supply of a stablecoin at a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Reserve Ratio:** The ratio of the value of reserve assets to the face value of outstanding stablecoins, which must always be ≥ 100%.\n*   **Stablecoin:** A digital currency designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified asset or basket of assets, typically a fiat currency.\n\n### 4. Policy Statement\nIt is the policy of PIDCA that all licensed stablecoin issuers must, at all times, maintain reserve assets equal to at least 100% of the face value of all outstanding stablecoins. These reserves must be held in Approved Assets, segregated from the issuer’s operational funds, and held under secure custody arrangements. Compliance with this policy must be verified through quarterly independent audits conducted by a PIDCA-approved audit firm. Any shortfall is a severe regulatory breach requiring immediate remedial action.\n\n### 5. Procedures\n**5.1 Reserve Composition & Management**\n*   **Approved Asset Classes:** Reserves must be held exclusively in the following:\n    *   **Cash and Cash Equivalents:** Deposits held in segregated accounts at regulated banks (Pitcairn Islands or OECD member jurisdictions).\n    *   **Short-Term Government Securities:** Debt instruments issued by the governments of the Pitcairn Islands, United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia, or New Zealand, with a remaining maturity of 90 days or less.\n    *   **Other assets as may be explicitly approved in writing by PIDCA.**\n*   **Prohibited Assets:** Cryptocurrencies, corporate bonds, equities, derivatives, and any illiquid or high-risk assets are strictly prohibited from inclusion in the reserve.\n*   **Segregation:** Reserve assets must be legally and operationally segregated from the issuer’s corporate assets and held in accounts designated solely for the benefit of stablecoin holders.\n*   **Valuation:** Assets must be valued daily at their fair market value using reliable pricing sources.\n\n**5.2 Custody Standards**\n*   All reserve assets must be held with a PIDCA-approved Custodian.\n*   Custodians must provide independent attestation of holdings on at least a monthly basis directly to the issuer and PIDCA.\n*   The issuer must maintain a written custody agreement that clearly establishes the fiduciary duty of the custodian and the segregation of assets.\n\n**5.3 Independent Audit Protocol**\n*   **Frequency:** Comprehensive third-party audits must be conducted quarterly, within 45 days of each quarter-end (March 31, June 30, September 30, December 31).\n*   **Auditor Qualification:** The audit must be performed by an independent, external audit firm registered with and approved by PIDCA.\n*   **Audit Scope:** The audit must, at a minimum:\n    1.  Attest to the existence, ownership, and value of all reserve assets as of the quarter-end date.\n    2.  Verify the total circulating supply of the stablecoin.\n    3.  Confirm the Reserve Ratio is ≥ 100%.\n    4.  Assess compliance with all aspects of this policy, including asset eligibility and custody arrangements.\n*   **Report Submission:** The final audit report must be submitted to PIDCA and published on the issuer’s public website within the 45-day deadline.\n\n### 6. Compliance Requirements\n*   **Daily Attestation:** Issuers must internally calculate and monitor the Reserve Ratio daily.\n*   **Monthly Reporting:** Issuers must submit a monthly reserve summary to PIDCA, certified by the Chief Financial Officer, including asset breakdowns and custodian confirmations.\n*   **Quarterly Audit Submission:** As per Section 5.3.\n*   **Public Disclosure:** A summary of the latest audit report and current reserve composition must be prominently displayed on the issuer’s website, updated quarterly.\n*   **Breach Notification:** Any event causing or likely to cause a reserve shortfall must be reported to PIDCA immediately, and a corrective action plan must be submitted within 24 hours.\n\n### 7. Review and Update Schedule\nThis policy will be reviewed annually by PIDCA to ensure its continued effectiveness and alignment with evolving regulatory standards and market practices. Updates may be made more frequently in response to significant regulatory changes or systemic risks.\n\n### 8. References to Regulatory Requirements\nThis policy is issued under the authority of and is designed to ensure compliance with:\n*   **Pitcairn Islands Digital Asset Regulation 2023 (PIDAR), Part III: Stablecoin Issuance.**\n*   **PIDCA Regulatory Directive 2024-01: Reserve Adequacy for Stable Value Digital Assets.**\n*   The core regulatory requirement mandating: *\"Stablecoin issuers must maintain 1:1 reserves in approved assets with regular independent audits.\"*\n```"

independent audit protocols\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting\n\n**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT framework specific to Pitcairn Islands regulatory expectations\n\n**Gap:** Absence of policies addressing Pitcairn Islands-specific AML/CFT requirements, including local reporting obligations, risk assessment methodologies, and regulatory liaison procedures\n\n**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, potential criminal prosecution for money laundering violations, reputational damage, and loss of banking relationships\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement Pitcairn Islands-specific AML/CFT program including customer identification procedures, transaction monitoring thresholds, and suspicious activity reporting mechanisms to local Financial Intelligence Unit\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive consumer protection policy including clear redemption terms, fee disclosure requirements, and formal complaint escalation procedures compliant with Pitcairn Islands standards\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity standards for stablecoin
