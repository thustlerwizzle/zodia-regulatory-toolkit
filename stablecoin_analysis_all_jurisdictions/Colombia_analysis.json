This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Colombia\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-01-30T20:47:17.942882\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company's current policy framework shows a complete absence of documented policies addressing the core regulatory requirements for operating with stablecoins in Colombia. Based on standard regulatory expectations for digital assets and Colombia's financial regulatory environment, compliance status is 'not_met' across all critical domains. This represents an extreme level of regulatory risk. Immediate action is required to develop a foundational compliance program, starting with critical gaps in licensing, AML/CFT, and consumer protection. The analysis is based on inferred regulatory principles due to limited specific research results; a formal legal assessment using local counsel is the highest-priority next step.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Registration/Licensing for stablecoin issuers and service providers (based on Colombian financial regulatory framework and regional trends)\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing the need for regulatory registration or licensing with Colombian authorities (potentially the Financial Superintendence of Colombia - SFC or Banco de la República).\n\n**Impact:** Operating without required authorization could result in enforcement actions, fines, business suspension, and reputational damage.\n\n**Recommendation:** Immediately initiate a regulatory mapping exercise to determine specific licensing requirements. Develop a policy outlining the registration process, responsible parties, and compliance monitoring for any stablecoin issuance or related financial services in Colombia.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CFT) compliance, including customer due diligence (CDD), transaction monitoring, and reporting suspicious activities.\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found\n\n**Gap:** No policies exist to address AML/CFT obligations specific to stablecoin transactions, which are likely covered under Colombia's AML law (Law 1908 of 2018) and UIAF (Financial Information and Analysis Unit) requirements.\n\n**Impact:** High risk of facilitating financial crime, severe regulatory penalties, and potential criminal liability for the company and its officers.\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop a comprehensive AML/CFT policy for digital assets, incorporating risk-based CDD, transaction monitoring systems, suspicious activity reporting procedures, and employee training programs aligned with Colombian UIAF standards.\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures, including clear disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling procedures.\n\n**Recommendation:** Create a consumer protection policy detailing terms of service, fee schedules, redemption processes, risk disclosures, and a structured customer complaint resolution framework compliant with Colombian consumer protection law (Estatuto del Consumidor).\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Prudential requirements for reserve management (if issuing stablecoins).\n\n**Recommendation:** If issuing stablecoins, draft a reserve management policy specifying eligible assets, custody arrangements, audit frequency (preferably by a Colombian-authorized auditor), and public reporting standards for reserve composition and value.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity standards.\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement a robust operational risk and cybersecurity policy framework tailored to digital assets, covering secure key generation/storage, multi-signature protocols, incident response plans, and regular penetration testing.\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **Registration/Licensing**: not_met\n❌ **AML/CFT Compliance**: not_met\n❌ **Consumer Protection**: not_met\n❌ **Reserve Management (if issuer)**: not_met\n❌ **Operational Risk & Cybersecurity**: not_met\n❌ **Tax Compliance**: not_met\n❌ **Record-Keeping & Data Governance**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update Summary\nGenerated: 2026-01-30T20:47:57.988400\n\n## Overview\nThis document summarizes proposed updates to company policies and standards based on regulatory gap analysis.\n\n## New Policies Required\n\n## Modified Policies\n\n### GAP-001\n**Category:** Compliance\n**Current Policy:** No documented policy found\n**Proposed Change:** Immediately initiate a regulatory mapping exercise to determine specific licensing requirements. Develop a policy outlining the registration process, responsible parties, and compliance monitoring for any stablecoin issuance or related financial services in Colombia.\n\n### GAP-002\n**Category:** AML/KYC\n**Current Policy:** No documented policy found\n**Proposed Change:** Develop a comprehensive AML/CFT policy for digital assets, incorporating risk-based CDD, transaction monitoring systems, suspicious activity reporting procedures, and employee training programs aligned with Colombian UIAF standards.\n\n### GAP-003\n**Category:** Data Protection\n**Current Policy:** No documented policy found\n**Proposed Change:** Create a consumer protection policy detailing terms of service, fee schedules, redemption processes, risk disclosures, and a structured customer complaint resolution framework compliant with Colombian consumer protection law (Estatuto del Consumidor).\n\n### GAP-004\n**Category:** Risk Management\n**Current Policy:** No documented policy found\n**Proposed Change:** If issuing stablecoins, draft a reserve management policy specifying eligible assets, custody arrangements, audit frequency (preferably by a Colombian-authorized auditor), and public reporting standards for reserve composition and value.\n\n### GAP-005\n**Category:** Risk Management\n**Current Policy:** No documented policy found\n**Proposed Change:** Implement a robust operational risk and cybersecurity policy framework tailored to digital assets, covering secure key generation/storage, multi-signature protocols, incident response plans, and regular penetration testing.\n\n### GAP-006\n**Category:** Compliance\n**Current Policy:** No documented policy found\n**Proposed Change:** Develop a tax compliance policy in consultation with local tax experts. The policy should define taxable events, record-keeping requirements, and reporting procedures for both the company and its users (if required to report).\n\n### GAP-007\n**Category:** Data Protection\n**Current Policy:** No documented policy found\n**Proposed Change:** Establish a comprehensive record-keeping and data governance policy that specifies retention periods (typically 5+ years in Colombia), data formats, secure storage solutions, and protocols for responding to authorized information requests.\n\n\n\n## Policy Implementation\n\n✅ **Automatically implemented 7 policies**\n\n📁 **Saved to:** C:\\Users\\takun\\Desktop\\Regulatory_Policies\n\n📄 **Summary file:** C:\\Users\\takun\\Desktop\\Regulatory_Policies\\IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md\n\n\n### Implemented Policies:\n\n- **GAP-001** (Compliance) - Compliance_GAP-001.md\n\n- **GAP-002** (AML/KYC) - AML_KYC_GAP-002.md\n\n- **GAP-003** (Data Protection) - Data Protection_GAP-003.md\n\n- **GAP-004** (Risk Management) - Risk Management_GAP-004.md\n\n- **GAP-005** (Risk Management) - Risk Management_GAP-005.md\n\n- **GAP-006** (Compliance) - Compliance_GAP-006.md\n\n- **GAP-007** (Data Protection) - Data Protection_GAP-007.md\n\n\n"
