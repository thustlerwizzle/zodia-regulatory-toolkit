# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T05:08:23.197493

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits a complete absence of policies and procedures related to stablecoin operations in Albania. This represents a critical compliance failure with potentially severe legal, financial, and reputational consequences. Immediate action is required to: 1) Halt any stablecoin operations until regulatory clarity is obtained, 2) Engage Albanian legal and regulatory experts, 3) Develop comprehensive policies across all regulatory domains, and 4) Establish a robust compliance monitoring program. The current state poses existential risks to the business and requires executive-level attention and resource allocation.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Legal framework for stablecoin issuance and operation in Albania

**Current Status:** No documented policy exists

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing stablecoin operations, including issuance, redemption, reserve management, and consumer protection

**Impact:** Operating without regulatory compliance could result in legal penalties, license revocation, financial sanctions, and reputational damage

**Recommendation:** Immediately establish a working group to research Albanian financial regulations, engage with the Bank of Albania and Financial Supervisory Authority, and develop a comprehensive stablecoin policy framework

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance for virtual asset service providers

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Licensing and registration requirements

**Current Status:** No documentation of regulatory licensing status

**Gap:** Unclear whether company has obtained necessary licenses from Albanian authorities to operate stablecoin services

**Impact:** Operating without proper licensing could result in immediate shutdown, substantial fines, and potential criminal charges

**Recommendation:** Immediately engage legal counsel to determine licensing requirements and initiate application process with relevant Albanian regulatory bodies

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Capital adequacy and reserve requirements

**Recommendation:** Establish clear reserve management policies including asset composition requirements, independent custody arrangements, regular audits, and public disclosure mechanisms

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive consumer protection framework including clear disclosures, redemption policies, complaint procedures, and user education materials

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive cybersecurity framework, conduct regular security audits, establish incident response team, and develop business continuity plans
