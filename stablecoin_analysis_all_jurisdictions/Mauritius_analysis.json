We prohibit all business relationships and transactions involving illicit activities and will cooperate fully with competent authorities.\n\n## 5. Procedures\n\n### A. Risk-Based Approach (RBA)\n1. **Risk Assessment:** Conduct a periodic (at least annual) enterprise-wide ML/TF risk assessment considering:\n   - Customer types (e.g., individuals, MSBs, corporates)\n   - Geography (country/jurisdiction risks)\n   - Products and services (e.g., private wallet transfers, fiat on/off ramps)\n   - Delivery channels (e.g., web platform, API)\n   - Transaction size, volume, and patterns\n\n2. **Risk Mitigation:** Implement controls proportionate to the identified risk levels (Low, Medium, High).\n\n### B. Customer Due Diligence (CDD)\n1. **Standard CDD:** Applied to all customers at onboarding, including:\n   - Identification and verification of identity using reliable, independent source documents or data.\n   - Identification of beneficial owners (for legal persons/arrangements).\n   - Understanding the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship.\n   - Ongoing monitoring of transactions to ensure consistency with the customer's profile.\n\n2. **Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD):** Mandatory for high-risk categories, including:\n   - PEPs, their family members, and close associates.\n   - Customers from high-risk jurisdictions.\n   - Customers involved in complex, unusually large, or unusual pattern transactions.\n   - Private wallet transactions exceeding defined thresholds.\n   - EDD measures include obtaining senior management approval, establishing source of wealth/funds, and conducting increased ongoing monitoring.\n\n3. **Simplified Due Diligence:** May be applied only where the ML/TF risk is demonstrably low, in strict accordance with the Act.\n\n4. **Timing of Verification:** CDD must be completed before establishing a business relationship or conducting an occasional transaction. In specific, non-risk scenarios, verification may be completed *during* establishment, provided ML/TF risks are effectively managed.\n\n### C. Transaction Monitoring and Reporting\n1. **Automated Monitoring System:** Maintain a system to monitor customer transactions for unusual or suspicious patterns. Parameters will be calibrated based on the company’s risk assessment.\n2. **Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR):** Any employee who detects a suspicious transaction must immediately report it to the Compliance Officer. The Compliance Officer will investigate and, if warranted, file a SAR with the FIU without delay and without tipping off the customer.\n3. **Record Keeping:** Maintain all CDD information, transaction records, and SAR documentation for a minimum period of seven (7) years from the date of transaction or end of business relationship, as required by law.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n- **Designated Compliance Officer:** A qualified Compliance Officer (MLRO) is appointed with full responsibility, authority, and independence to implement and oversee the AML/CFT program.\n- **Employee Training:** All relevant personnel must undergo annual AML/CFT training, covering obligations under this policy, red flag indicators, and SAR procedures.\n- **Independent Audit:** The AML/CFT program will be subject to an independent internal or external audit at least every two years.\n- **Sanctions Screening:** All customers (natural and legal persons) must be screened against relevant national and international sanctions lists (e.g., UN, OFAC) at onboarding and on an ongoing basis.\n\n## 7.

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Mauritius\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-02-06T02:07:26.410447\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company exhibits significant regulatory compliance gaps across all major areas of Mauritius stablecoin regulation. Current policies are either non-existent or insufficient to meet Financial Services Commission requirements. Critical gaps exist in licensing, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance. Immediate action is required to develop comprehensive policies and initiate licensing applications to avoid regulatory enforcement actions. The company should prioritize establishing basic compliance infrastructure before commencing or continuing stablecoin operations in Mauritius.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Licensing requirement for stablecoin issuers under Mauritius Financial Services Act and Virtual Asset and Initial Token Offering Services Act 2021\n\n**Current Status:** No

stablecoin issuance activities\n\n**Impact:** Operating without proper license could result in regulatory enforcement actions, fines, business suspension, and reputational damage\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop licensing framework policy and initiate FSC application process for Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Reserve requirements and asset backing for stablecoins (typically 1:1 backing with high-quality liquid assets)\n\n**Current Status:** No documented reserve management or asset backing policies\n\n**Gap:** Missing policies governing reserve composition, custody, audit requirements, and redemption mechanisms\n\n**Impact:** Failure to maintain adequate reserves could lead to insolvency, loss of peg, regulatory sanctions, and loss of consumer trust\n\n**Recommendation:** Create comprehensive reserve management policy including asset composition rules, custody arrangements, and independent audit requirements\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance under Financial Intelligence and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2002\n\n**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT policies specific to stablecoin operations\n\n**Gap:** Lacks customer due diligence (CDD), transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and record-keeping procedures for stablecoin transactions\n\n**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties, potential criminal liability, and inclusion in international watchlists\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop VASP-specific AML/CFT program with risk-based approach, CDD procedures, and transaction monitoring systems\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive consumer protection framework including clear disclosures, redemption policies, and complaint resolution procedures\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Cybersecurity and operational resilience requirements\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish cybersecurity framework meeting FSC guidelines for VASPs, including cold storage policies and incident response plans\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-006\n**Requirement:** Governance and risk management framework\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement three lines of defense model with clear governance structure, risk appetite statement, and compliance monitoring\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **licensing_requirements**: not_met\n❌ **reserve_management**: not_met\n❌ **aml_cft_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **consumer_protection**: not_met\n❌
