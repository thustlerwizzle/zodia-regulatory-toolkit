# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-31T07:07:28.114993

## Executive Summary
The company currently exhibits comprehensive non-compliance with Kuwait's regulatory framework for stablecoin operations. No documented policies exist across all critical regulatory domains, creating severe legal, operational, and reputational risks. Immediate action is required to establish basic compliance infrastructure before any operational activities commence. The most critical gaps requiring immediate attention are licensing/authorization and AML/CTF compliance, as operating without these could result in immediate regulatory enforcement actions. A phased implementation approach is recommended, starting with regulatory engagement and licensing, followed by development of core compliance programs.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK) requires all payment service providers, including stablecoin issuers, to obtain proper licensing and authorization before operation.

**Current Status:** No documented licensing or authorization policy exists.

**Gap:** Complete absence of licensing framework and procedures for engaging with CBK regulatory authorities.

**Impact:** Operating without proper authorization could result in immediate cease-and-desist orders, substantial fines, and potential criminal liability for company executives.

**Recommendation:** Immediately establish a regulatory engagement team to research CBK licensing requirements for payment institutions and develop a formal licensing application strategy.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** CBK mandates strict anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) compliance for all financial service providers, including customer due diligence (CDD), transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting.

**Current Status:** No AML/CTF policies or procedures documented.

**Gap:** Missing comprehensive AML/CTF program including customer identification, risk assessment, transaction monitoring, and reporting mechanisms.

**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, potential loss of banking relationships, reputational damage, and increased risk of facilitating illicit financial activities.

**Recommendation:** Develop and implement a comprehensive AML/CTF program aligned with Kuwait's AML Law No. 106 of 2013 and CBK regulations, including KYC procedures, risk-based customer due diligence, and suspicious transaction reporting protocols.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** CBK requires adequate capital reserves and liquidity management for payment service providers to ensure operational stability and consumer protection.

**Recommendation:** Establish capital adequacy and liquidity management policies that meet or exceed CBK requirements, including regular stress testing and reserve reporting procedures.

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection regulations require clear disclosure of terms, risks, fees, and redemption procedures for stablecoin holders.

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive consumer protection policies including clear disclosure documents, standardized terms of service, risk warnings, and transparent redemption procedures compliant with Kuwaiti consumer protection laws.

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Data protection and privacy requirements under Kuwait's Personal Data Protection Law (PDPL) mandate proper handling of customer information.

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive data protection policies aligned with Kuwait's PDPL, including data classification, access controls, breach notification procedures, and privacy impact assessments.

### Gap 4: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity requirements for financial institutions in Kuwait.

**Recommendation:** Develop and implement a comprehensive cybersecurity framework, incident response plan, and business continuity program meeting CBK expectations for financial service providers.
