# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T19:55:02.224369

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company lacks any documented policies for stablecoin operations in Burundi, representing a complete regulatory compliance failure. All identified regulatory requirements are unmet. Immediate action is required to suspend operations and develop comprehensive compliance framework. The highest priority gaps involve operating without legal authority (licensing) and lacking AML/CFT controls, both of which carry severe legal and financial consequences. The company must engage local legal counsel immediately to understand Burundi's regulatory landscape before proceeding with any operations.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Legal framework for stablecoin issuance and operation in Burundi

**Current Status:** No documented policies found

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing stablecoin operations in Burundi. No legal analysis, licensing requirements, or operational guidelines established.

**Impact:** Operating without legal framework exposes company to regulatory enforcement, fines, license revocation, and potential criminal liability.

**Recommendation:** Immediately suspend stablecoin operations in Burundi until legal analysis is completed. Engage local legal counsel to research Burundi's financial regulations and central bank policies regarding digital assets.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance for digital asset service providers

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT policies for Burundi operations

**Gap:** No policies addressing customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, or record-keeping requirements specific to Burundi's AML/CFT regime.

**Impact:** High risk of facilitating money laundering or terrorist financing. Potential for severe penalties, reputational damage, and loss of banking relationships.

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive AML/CFT program aligned with Burundi's legal requirements and FATF recommendations. Implement KYC procedures, transaction monitoring systems, and suspicious activity reporting protocols.

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Licensing and registration with Burundi financial authorities

**Current Status:** No licensing strategy or documentation

**Gap:** No analysis of required licenses, no application process, and no engagement with Burundi's central bank or financial regulators.

**Impact:** Operating without required licenses constitutes illegal financial services provision, subject to immediate shutdown, fines, and potential criminal charges.

**Recommendation:** Immediately research licensing requirements with local counsel. Prepare license application package. Establish regulatory engagement strategy with Bank of the Republic of Burundi.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Reserve requirements and asset backing for stablecoins

**Recommendation:** Establish reserve management policy requiring 1:1 backing with high-quality liquid assets. Implement regular third-party audits and public attestations. Create segregation of customer funds from company assets.

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements

**Recommendation:** Develop localized terms of service, risk disclosure documents, and complaint resolution procedures compliant with Burundi consumer protection laws.

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Data privacy and cybersecurity requirements

**Recommendation:** Conduct data protection impact assessment. Develop privacy policy compliant with Burundi's data protection laws. Implement cybersecurity framework with incident response plan.
