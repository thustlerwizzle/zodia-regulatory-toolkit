# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-31T00:45:14.691642

## Executive Summary
The company's current policies present a state of total non-compliance with the anticipated and foundational regulatory requirements for operating a stablecoin in a jurisdiction like Iraq. The regulatory environment for stablecoins in Iraq is uncertain but can be inferred to be highly restrictive based on the CBI's historical stance on crypto-assets. The gaps are severe and systemic, covering licensing, financial integrity (AML), consumer safety, and financial stability. Immediate and fundamental policy development is required before any market activity can be responsibly considered. The highest priority is to establish legal clarity and implement robust AML/CFT controls to mitigate the critical risks of operating in a high-risk jurisdiction.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Legal authorization to issue stablecoins in Iraq

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** Company lacks any policy addressing the legal framework for stablecoin issuance in Iraq. The Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) has historically maintained a restrictive stance on cryptocurrencies, and specific regulations for stablecoins are likely under development or non-existent. Operating without clear authorization poses significant legal risk.

**Impact:** Potential for regulatory enforcement actions, including cease-and-desist orders, fines, and criminal liability. Could lead to seizure of assets and reputational damage.

**Recommendation:** 1. Immediately suspend any stablecoin-related operations targeting Iraq until a legal assessment is completed. 2. Engage local legal counsel to clarify the current regulatory landscape from the CBI and the Securities Commission. 3. Develop a policy that mandates obtaining formal regulatory approval or a license before launching any product or service in Iraq.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (CFT) compliance specific to virtual assets.

**Current Status:** No documented policy found

**Gap:** No AML/CFT policy exists that addresses the specific risks associated with stablecoins, such as transaction monitoring for mixing/tumbling, wallet screening, and enhanced due diligence for high-value or Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) transactions. Iraq is a high-risk jurisdiction from an AML perspective.

**Impact:** High risk of facilitating financial crime, leading to severe penalties from Iraqi and international regulators (e.g., FATF). Could result in loss of correspondent banking relationships and exclusion from the global financial system.

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop a comprehensive Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) AML/CFT policy aligned with FATF Recommendations 15 and 16. 2. Implement a risk-based approach with mandatory Customer Due Diligence (CDD), ongoing transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting procedures. 3. Appoint a local AML compliance officer if required by future Iraqi regulations.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements.

**Recommendation:** 1. Draft a consumer protection policy mandating clear, accessible, and non-misleading disclosures. 2. Create standardized terms of service and risk warnings for Iraqi users. 3. Policy must require regular, public reporting on reserve attestations/audits by a reputable third-party firm.

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Reserve management and custody requirements for asset-backed stablecoins.

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop a stringent reserve management policy. 2. Mandate that reserves are held 1:1 with the issued stablecoins in segregated, bankruptcy-remote accounts with a licensed custodian. 3. Require monthly attestations and full quarterly audits of the reserves by a registered public accounting firm.
