[Issuer Name] will engage an independent, reputable accounting firm registered with the CBB to perform an attestation engagement on the reserve.\n2.  Attestation reports will be produced **at least quarterly** and must:\n    *   Confirm the value of the reserve assets equals or exceeds the aggregate face value of stablecoins in circulation as of the report date.\n    *   Verify the assets are held in segregated accounts with approved custodians.\n    *   Assess the composition of the reserve against the eligible HQLA criteria in this policy.\n    *   Be published on the company's website within 4 weeks of the period end.\n\n## 6.

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Bahrain\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-01-30T06:19:35.874509\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company currently has no documented policies addressing Bahrain's stablecoin regulatory requirements. This represents a critical compliance gap that prevents lawful operation of stablecoin services in Bahrain. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive policy framework aligned with CBB Rulebook Volume 6 before pursuing any stablecoin-related activities. The most critical gaps relate to licensing prerequisites, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance, which are fundamental to obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB) Rulebook Volume 6 (FinTech) requires stablecoin issuers to obtain a license under the Crypto-Asset Module (CRA) and comply with capital adequacy, governance, and risk management requirements.\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policies for stablecoin issuance or operations in Bahrain.\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing CBB licensing requirements, capital requirements, governance structure, and risk management framework for stablecoin operations.\n\n**Impact:** Operating without CBB license could result in regulatory enforcement actions, fines, business shutdown, and reputational damage.\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive stablecoin policy framework aligned with CBB Rulebook Volume 6, including licensing strategy, capital planning, governance model, and risk management protocols.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** CBB requires stablecoin issuers to maintain 100% reserve backing with high-quality liquid assets held in segregated accounts with regulated custodians.\n\n**Current Status:** No reserve management or custody policies exist.\n\n**Gap:** Missing policies for reserve composition, custody arrangements, segregation of assets, and regular attestation/audit requirements.\n\n**Impact:** Failure to maintain proper reserves could lead to insolvency, loss of customer funds, regulatory penalties, and loss of market confidence.\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish reserve management policy specifying eligible assets, custody arrangements with CBB-approved institutions, segregation requirements, and third-party attestation procedures.\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** CBB mandates comprehensive AML/CFT compliance including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting per Bahrain's AML Law and CBB Rulebook.\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop stablecoin-specific AML/CFT policy incorporating blockchain analytics, wallet screening, transaction monitoring, and travel rule compliance procedures.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** CBB requires stablecoin issuers to implement robust cybersecurity measures, operational resilience, and business continuity planning.\n\n**Recommendation:** Create comprehensive cybersecurity framework for stablecoin operations including smart contract auditing, key management, DDoS protection, and incident response plans.\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **CBB Licensing Requirements**: not_met\n❌ **Reserve Management Requirements**: not_met\n❌ **AML/CFT Compliance**: not_met\n❌ **Cybersecurity & Operational Resilience**: not_met\n❌ **Customer Disclosure Requirements**: not_met\n❌ **Governance Framework**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update Summary\nGenerated: 2026-01-30T06:20:13.969070\n\n## Overview\nThis document summarizes proposed updates to company policies and standards based on regulatory gap

monitoring, and travel rule compliance procedures.\n\n### GAP-004\n**Category:** Operational\n**Current Policy:** No documented cybersecurity or operational resilience policies for stablecoin infrastructure.\n**Proposed Change:** Create comprehensive cybersecurity framework for stablecoin operations including smart contract auditing, key management, DDoS protection, and incident response plans.\n\n### GAP-005\n**Category:** Risk Management\n**Current Policy:** No customer disclosure or transparency policies.\n**Proposed Change:** Develop customer disclosure policy covering all required elements under CBB regulations, including regular transparency reports on reserves and operations.\n\n### GAP-006\n**Category:** Compliance\n**Current Policy:** No governance framework
