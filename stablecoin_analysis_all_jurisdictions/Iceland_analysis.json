Purpose and Scope\n### 2.1 Purpose\nThe purpose of this policy is to establish a robust framework for the management, custody, and segregation of reserve assets backing issued stablecoins.

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Iceland\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-01-31T00:27:50.946328\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company exhibits a complete absence of documented policies and procedures required for stablecoin operations under Icelandic/EU regulations. Based on the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation applicable in Iceland through EU membership, all critical regulatory requirements are currently unmet. The company is operating in a state of severe non-compliance with no foundational compliance infrastructure. Immediate action is required to develop comprehensive policies across all regulatory domains, with priority given to authorization/licensing, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance. Without rapid remediation, the company faces significant regulatory, operational, and reputational risks that could threaten its continued operations.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Authorization/Licensing for stablecoin issuance and services (based on EU MiCA framework applicable in Iceland)\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found\n\n**Gap:** Company lacks any documented policies regarding authorization requirements for stablecoin issuance, custody, or exchange services under Icelandic/EU regulations\n\n**Impact:** Operating without proper authorization could result in regulatory enforcement actions, fines, license revocation, and reputational damage\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive licensing and authorization policy aligned with MiCA requirements, including application procedures, capital requirements, and governance standards\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Reserve asset management and segregation requirements for stablecoin issuers\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found\n\n**Gap:** No policies exist for managing reserve assets, maintaining adequate liquidity, or segregating customer funds as required by stablecoin regulations\n\n**Impact:** Failure to maintain proper reserves could lead to stablecoin depegging, consumer losses, regulatory sanctions, and loss of market confidence\n\n**Recommendation:** Create reserve management policy detailing asset composition, custody arrangements, regular attestations/audits, and segregation requirements\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance for virtual asset service providers (VASPs)\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy found\n\n**Gap:** Complete absence of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing policies required for stablecoin service providers\n\n**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties, potential criminal liability, loss of banking relationships, and exclusion from financial system\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive AML/CFT program including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and record-keeping procedures\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop consumer protection framework including clear terms of service, risk disclosures, redemption procedures, and complaint resolution mechanisms\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity requirements\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish comprehensive operational resilience framework including cybersecurity protocols, business continuity plans, and incident response procedures\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-006\n**Requirement:** Governance and risk management framework\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement formal governance framework including board oversight, risk management committee, internal audit function, and compliance monitoring\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **authorization_licensing**: not_met\n❌ **reserve_management**: not_met\n❌ **aml_cft_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **consumer_protection**:
