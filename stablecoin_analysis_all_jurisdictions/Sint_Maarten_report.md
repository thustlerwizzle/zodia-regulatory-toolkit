# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-11T21:20:17.173492

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits complete non-compliance with Sint Maarten's stablecoin regulatory framework. No policies exist to address fundamental requirements including licensing, reserve management, AML/CFT, consumer protection, or operational risk. This represents an existential regulatory risk that must be addressed immediately before any stablecoin operations commence. The organization requires a comprehensive regulatory compliance program development, starting with engagement with the Central Bank of Sint Maarten to clarify specific requirements, followed by policy development across all identified gap areas. Critical gaps must be addressed before any market entry, with high priority gaps resolved during the licensing application process.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance requires licensing/registration with Central Bank of Sint Maarten (CBSM) under financial institution regulations

**Current Status:** No documented policy for stablecoin issuance or regulatory registration

**Gap:** Complete absence of policy framework for obtaining necessary regulatory approvals to issue stablecoins in Sint Maarten jurisdiction

**Impact:** Potential regulatory enforcement actions, fines, license revocation, and criminal liability for operating without proper authorization

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive licensing strategy and policy framework for CBSM engagement, including application procedures, documentation requirements, and compliance monitoring

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must maintain adequate reserves (likely 100% backing) with regular attestations/audits

**Current Status:** No reserve management or audit policies documented

**Gap:** Missing policies for reserve composition, custody, valuation, and independent verification requirements

**Impact:** Regulatory sanctions, loss of consumer confidence, potential insolvency, and reputational damage

**Recommendation:** Establish reserve management policy detailing asset types, custody arrangements, valuation methodologies, and third-party audit requirements

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting

**Current Status:** No documented AML/CFT policies for stablecoin operations

**Gap:** Lack of comprehensive anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing program specific to stablecoin products

**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, potential criminal liability, and inclusion on international watchlists

**Recommendation:** Develop risk-based AML/CFT program including KYC procedures, transaction monitoring systems, and reporting protocols aligned with FATF standards

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive consumer protection policy covering clear disclosures, redemption procedures, and formal complaint resolution process

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational risk management and cybersecurity requirements

**Recommendation:** Develop operational risk management framework including cybersecurity protocols, disaster recovery plans, and incident response procedures

### Gap 3: GAP-007
**Requirement:** Record-keeping and reporting obligations to regulatory authorities

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive record-keeping policy and regulatory reporting calendar detailing requirements, formats, and timelines
