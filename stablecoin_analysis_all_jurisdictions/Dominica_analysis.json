Purpose and Scope\n### 2.1 Purpose\nThis policy establishes the framework for ensuring that all stablecoin tokens issued by [Company Name] are fully backed by high-quality reserve assets, that these reserves are legally and operationally segregated from company operating assets, and that their management is transparent and verifiable by independent third parties. The primary objectives are to protect token holders, maintain price stability, and ensure compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements.\n\n### 2.2 Scope\nThis policy applies to:\n*   All departments and personnel involved in the issuance, redemption, or management of [Company Name] stablecoins (e.g., [Stablecoin Name(s)]).\n*   All assets designated as part of the reserve backing for outstanding stablecoin tokens.\n*   All third-party service providers, including custodians, auditors, and asset managers, engaged in reserve-related activities.\n*   The Board of Directors and relevant committees responsible for oversight.\n\n## 3. Definitions\n*   **Stablecoin:** A digital asset issued by [Company Name] designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified fiat currency (e.g., USD, EUR).\n*   **Reserve Assets:** The collective pool of high-quality, liquid assets held to fully back the value of all stablecoins in circulation.\n*   **Full Backing:** The requirement that the aggregate market value of the Reserve Assets, valued at least daily, must always equal or exceed the aggregate face value of all outstanding stablecoins.\n*   **Segregation:** The legal and operational separation of Reserve Assets from the general assets of [Company Name]. Reserve Assets are held for the exclusive benefit of stablecoin holders and are not available to satisfy claims of the company’s general creditors.\n*   **Qualified Custodian:** A regulated financial institution or trust company, meeting specific criteria defined in this policy, responsible for the safekeeping of Reserve Assets.\n*   **Attestation Report:** A formal report issued by an independent Certified Public Accountant (CPA) firm that provides assurance on management’s assertion regarding the adequacy and composition of the reserve.\n\n## 4. Policy Statement\n[Company Name] mandates that the issuance of any stablecoin must be strictly 1:1 backed by corresponding Reserve Assets. These Reserve Assets must be held in segregated accounts under the custody of a Qualified Custodian, entirely separate from the company’s operational funds. The company will ensure continuous, real-time (or daily at a minimum) compliance with the full backing requirement and will subject the reserve to regular, independent third-party audits and attestations to provide verifiable proof of reserves to regulators and the public.\n\n## 5. Procedures\n### 5.1 Reserve Composition & Eligibility\n*   Reserve Assets shall consist only of:\n    *   Cash and cash equivalents (e.g., demand deposits, Treasury bills).\n    *   Short-term government securities with minimal credit risk.\n    *   Other highly liquid, low-risk assets as pre-approved by the Compliance Officer and Risk Committee, in accordance with evolving regulatory guidance.\n*   A prohibited assets list will be maintained and includes corporate debt, equities, cryptocurrencies, and other volatile or illiquid instruments.\n\n### 5.2 Custody & Segregation\n*   All Reserve Assets must be held with one or more Qualified Custodians pre-approved by the Board’s Risk Committee.\n*   Custodial agreements must explicitly state that the assets are held in a segregated account for the sole benefit of stablecoin holders.\n*   [Company Name] will maintain a clear, documented chain of ownership and control for all Reserve Assets.\n\n### 5.3 Issuance & Redemption Process\n*   **Issuance:** A stablecoin may only be minted and issued upon receipt of equivalent fiat value, which must be deposited into the designated reserve account with the Qualified Custodian within one business day.\n*   **Redemption:** Upon a valid redemption request, the corresponding Reserve Asset value must be paid out to the redeemer, and the stablecoin must be promptly burned (permanently removed from circulation).\n\n### 5.4 Daily Reconciliation & Monitoring\n*   The Treasury Department will perform a daily reconciliation comparing the total number of stablecoins in circulation (by referencing the blockchain) with the total market value of Reserve Assets (as reported by the Custodian(s)).\n*   Any shortfall must be remedied immediately by depositing additional eligible assets. Any excess must be addressed per a pre-defined protocol.\n*   All reconciliations will be documented and logged.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n### 6.1 Independent Audits & Attestations\n*   [Company Name] will engage an independent, reputable CPA firm to perform a **monthly attestation** on management’s assertion regarding reserve adequacy.\n*   A **full annual audit** of the reserve holdings will be conducted in accordance with relevant auditing standards (e.g., SOC 1, SOC 2, or agreed-upon procedures).\n*   Summary results of the monthly attestations and the full annual audit report will be published on the company’s website within 30 days of receipt.\n\n### 6.2 Regulatory Reporting\n*   The Compliance Officer is responsible for filing all required reports related to reserve management with relevant regulatory bodies (e.g., state money transmitter regulators, federal agencies) as mandated by law.\n*   All records related to reserve transactions, reconciliations, audits, and custody agreements shall be retained for a minimum of five (5) years, or longer if required by specific regulation.\n\n### 6.3 Roles and Responsibilities\n*   **Board of Directors / Risk Committee:** Ultimate oversight of policy adherence and reserve safety.\n*   **Chief Compliance Officer:** Responsible for policy implementation, regulatory reporting, and overseeing the audit process.\n*   **Treasury Department:** Responsible for day-to-day reserve management, daily reconciliation, and execution of issuance/redemption processes.\n*   **Internal Audit:** Will conduct periodic reviews to ensure procedural compliance with this policy.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule\nThis policy shall be reviewed at least **annually** by the Compliance Officer and the Risk Committee. It will be updated promptly in response to:\n*   Changes in applicable laws or regulations.\n*   Material changes in business operations or stablecoin products.\n*   Findings from internal or external audits that necessitate policy revision.\n*   The annual review date is set for [Month, Day] of each year.\n\n## 8. References to Regulatory Requirements\nThis policy is designed to comply with, but is not necessarily limited to, the following regulatory frameworks and guidance:\n*   **Federal:** Relevant guidance from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Federal Reserve, and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) pertaining to payment stablecoins and reserve assets.\n*   **State:** Regulations in states where [Company Name] is licensed as a Money Services Business (MSB) or Money Transmitter, particularly those with specific stablecoin or virtual currency regulations (e.g., New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) Part 200).\n*   **International:** Principles from international standard-setting bodies such as the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision regarding stablecoin arrangements.\n*   **Key Principle:** Adherence to the regulatory requirement that **\"stablecoin reserves must be fully backed and segregated from company assets.\"**\n\n---\n**Policy Version:** 1.0  \n**Effective Date:** [Date]  \n**Approved By:** [Name/Title of Approver]\n```"

Any excess must be addressed per a pre-defined protocol.\n*   All reconciliations will be documented and logged.\n\n## 6.
