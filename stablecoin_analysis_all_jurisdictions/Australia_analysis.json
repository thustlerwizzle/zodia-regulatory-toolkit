All critical regulatory areas are unaddressed, representing severe compliance risk. Immediate action is required to develop comprehensive policies across licensing, consumer protection, AML/CTF, reserve management, and operational resilience.

This notice will include: our identity and contact details, the purposes of collection, any legal requirements, to whom we usually disclose information, our Privacy Policy, and how individuals can access and correct their data.\n- Collection will be limited to information necessary for the defined purpose.\n\n### 5.2 Use and Disclosure\n- Personal information will not be used or disclosed for a secondary purpose unless:\n    - The individual has consented;\n    - The individual would reasonably expect the use/disclosure for that secondary purpose (and it is related to the primary purpose); or\n    - It is required or authorised by Australian law.\n- Cross-border disclosures of personal information will only occur after taking reasonable steps to ensure the overseas recipient complies with the APPs, or the individual has consented, or it is otherwise permitted under the Act.\n\n### 5.3 Data Quality and Security\n- Reasonable steps will be taken to ensure personal information is accurate, complete, and up-to-date.\n- Personal information will be stored in secure environments (both physical and electronic), protected by measures such as encryption, access controls, firewalls, and secure office premises.\n- Access to personal information is restricted to authorised personnel on a need-to-know basis.\n\n### 5.4 Data Breach Response Procedure\n1. **Contain:** Upon suspicion or detection of an eligible data breach, immediate steps will be taken to contain the breach and prevent further unauthorised access or disclosure.\n2. **Assess:** The Privacy Officer will promptly assess the breach to determine if it is likely to result in serious harm to any individual (an \"eligible data breach\").\n3. **Notify:**\n    - If an eligible data breach is confirmed, the OAIC will be notified as soon as practicable via the Notifiable Data Breach form.\n    - Affected individuals will be notified if the breach is likely to result in serious harm. The notification will include a description of the breach, the kinds of information concerned, and recommendations for the steps individuals should take.\n    - If direct notification is impractical, a public notification will be made.\n4. **Review:** Following a breach, a post-incident review will be conducted to identify the cause and implement corrective actions to prevent future breaches.\n\n### 5.5 Access and Correction\n- Individuals may request access to their personal information held by us.\n- Requests will be processed within a reasonable period (generally 30 days). Reasonable fees may apply for providing access.\n- If personal information is inaccurate, out-of-date, incomplete, irrelevant, or misleading, individuals may request correction. Reasonable steps will be taken to correct the information.\n\n## 6. Compliance Requirements\n- All personnel involved in stablecoin operations must complete annual privacy training.\n- The designated **Privacy Officer** is responsible for implementing this policy, handling enquiries and complaints, and liaising with the OAIC.\n- Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contracts.\n- Third-party service providers must contractually agree to handle personal information in accordance with the APPs and this policy.\n\n## 7. Review and Update Schedule\nThis policy will be reviewed:\n- **Annually**, as a minimum requirement.\n- Following any significant change in privacy law or regulatory guidance.\n- Following a material data breach or privacy incident.\n- When introducing new stablecoin products, services, or technologies that involve new data handling practices.\n\nThe Privacy Officer is responsible for coordinating the review and proposing updates for approval by the Executive Committee.\n\n## 8.

This may be due to:\n- API key issues (check your .env file)\n- Rate limiting\n- Network connectivity issues\n\nQuery: stablecoin regulation Australia\n\nThe agent will proceed with analysis based on available information and LLM knowledge.\n\n\n\n# Gap Analysis Report\nGenerated: 2026-01-30T05:53:49.205040\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe company exhibits a complete lack of regulatory compliance framework for stablecoin operations in Australia. All critical regulatory areas are unaddressed, representing severe compliance risk. Immediate action is required to develop comprehensive policies across licensing, consumer protection, AML/CTF, reserve management, and operational resilience. The current state poses existential risk to the business, with potential for regulatory enforcement, significant fines, and criminal liability. A phased implementation approach is recommended, beginning with critical licensing and AML/CTF requirements, followed by consumer protection and operational policies.\n\n## Critical Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-001\n**Requirement:** Licensing requirement for stablecoin issuers under Australian financial services laws (AFSL requirement for financial product issuance)\n\n**Current Status:** No documented policy on licensing or regulatory registration\n\n**Gap:** Company lacks policies addressing the need for an Australian Financial Services License (AFSL) or equivalent authorization to issue stablecoins in Australia\n\n**Impact:** Potential regulatory enforcement, fines, cease-and-desist orders, and criminal liability for operating without proper authorization\n\n**Recommendation:** Immediately engage legal counsel to determine AFSL requirements and develop licensing strategy. Create policy framework for regulatory registration and licensing compliance.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-002\n**Requirement:** Consumer protection requirements including disclosure, transparency, and fair dealing under ASIC regulatory framework\n\n**Current Status:** No documented consumer protection policies specific to stablecoin operations\n\n**Gap:** Missing policies for consumer disclosures, terms of service, risk warnings, and complaint handling procedures required by ASIC\n\n**Impact:** Regulatory action for unfair practices, consumer harm, reputational damage, and potential class action lawsuits\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive consumer protection policy including clear disclosures, redemption procedures, risk warnings, and complaint resolution mechanisms.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-003\n**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing (AML/CTF) compliance under AUSTRAC regulations\n\n**Current Status:** No documented AML/CTF program for stablecoin operations\n\n**Gap:** Company lacks AML/CTF program including customer identification, transaction monitoring, suspicious matter reporting, and record-keeping\n\n**Impact:** Significant fines, criminal prosecution, loss of banking relationships, and regulatory sanctions\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive AML/CTF program including KYC procedures, transaction monitoring systems, and AUSTRAC reporting protocols.\n\n## High Priority Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: GAP-004\n**Requirement:** Reserve management and custody requirements for stablecoin backing assets\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish reserve management policy detailing asset composition, custody arrangements, audit requirements, and redemption mechanisms.\n\n### Gap 2: GAP-005\n**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity requirements for payment systems\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop operational resilience framework including cybersecurity standards, incident response plans, and business continuity procedures.\n\n### Gap 3: GAP-008\n**Requirement:** Data privacy and protection under Privacy Act 1988 and Australian Privacy Principles\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive privacy policy compliant with Australian Privacy Principles, including data breach response procedures.\n\n## Compliance Status\n\n❌ **licensing_and_authorization**: not_met\n❌ **consumer_protection**: not_met\n❌ **aml_ctf_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **reserve_management**: not_met\n❌ **operational_resilience**: not_met\n❌ **market_conduct**: not_met\n❌ **tax_compliance**: not_met\n❌ **data_privacy**: not_met\n\n\n\n# Policy Update Summary\nGenerated: 2026-01-30T05:54:32.444074\n\n## Overview\nThis document summarizes proposed updates to company policies and standards based on regulatory gap analysis.\n\n## New Policies Required\n\n## Modified Policies\n\n### GAP-001\n**Category:** Compliance\n**Current Policy:** No documented policy on licensing or regulatory registration\n**Proposed Change:** Immediately engage legal counsel to determine AFSL requirements and develop licensing strategy.
