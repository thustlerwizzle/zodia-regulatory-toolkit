# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-30T21:15:48.440471

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits a complete absence of documented policies addressing stablecoin regulatory requirements. All critical regulatory areas show significant gaps, with particular concern regarding Cuban regulatory compliance where no research or framework exists. The current state represents high regulatory risk, with potential for severe enforcement actions, sanctions violations, and operational failures. Immediate action is required to develop a comprehensive compliance program beginning with jurisdictional analysis and basic policy frameworks.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Legal framework for stablecoin issuance and operation in Cuba

**Current Status:** No documented policy addressing Cuban regulatory requirements

**Gap:** Complete absence of policies addressing Cuban stablecoin regulations. No research or documentation exists regarding Cuba's specific legal stance on stablecoins, which may include licensing requirements, operational restrictions, or outright prohibitions.

**Impact:** Potential for illegal operations, regulatory enforcement actions, fines, seizure of assets, and reputational damage if operating in or serving Cuban markets without proper authorization.

**Recommendation:** 1. Conduct comprehensive regulatory research on Cuba's cryptocurrency and stablecoin regulations through legal counsel with Cuban expertise. 2. Establish a country-specific compliance framework before any operations involving Cuban markets or users. 3. Implement geographic restrictions if Cuban operations are prohibited.

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance for stablecoin transactions involving Cuba

**Current Status:** No specific AML/CFT policies addressing Cuban transactions or OFAC sanctions

**Gap:** Missing policies for screening Cuban transactions against OFAC sanctions lists and implementing enhanced due diligence for any permitted Cuban activities. No procedures for detecting and reporting suspicious transactions involving Cuban parties.

**Impact:** Violation of U.S. sanctions regulations, potential criminal penalties, loss of banking relationships, and regulatory enforcement actions from multiple jurisdictions.

**Recommendation:** 1. Implement OFAC screening for all transactions with geographic indicators pointing to Cuba. 2. Develop enhanced due diligence procedures for any permitted Cuban transactions. 3. Establish clear reporting protocols for sanctions violations.

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Consumer protection requirements for stablecoin services

**Recommendation:** 1. Develop comprehensive consumer protection framework including clear disclosures about stablecoin mechanics and risks. 2. Establish redemption policies and procedures. 3. Create complaint resolution mechanisms. 4. Implement reserve transparency reporting if required.

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Licensing and registration requirements for stablecoin issuers

**Recommendation:** 1. Conduct jurisdictional analysis for all target markets. 2. Develop licensing strategy and application processes. 3. Create regulatory reporting framework for licensed operations.

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Reserve management and auditing requirements

**Recommendation:** 1. Establish reserve management policy with clear composition requirements. 2. Implement segregation of customer funds. 3. Schedule regular independent audits. 4. Develop public reporting framework for reserve status.
