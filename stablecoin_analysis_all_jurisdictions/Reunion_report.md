# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-12T16:58:25.771197

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently has no documented policies addressing stablecoin regulatory requirements. Based on analysis against MiCA framework (applicable in EU territories including Reunion), FATF standards, and general financial regulations, all core regulatory requirements are unmet. This represents extreme regulatory risk with potential for immediate enforcement actions, substantial fines, and criminal liability. The company must prioritize establishing foundational compliance policies before any stablecoin operations, beginning with licensing/authorization, reserve management, and AML/CFT compliance. Given Reunion's status as an EU overseas department, MiCA regulations will be directly applicable once fully implemented, requiring urgent preparation.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuance requires authorization/licensing from financial authorities (based on EU MiCA framework and global stablecoin regulatory trends)

**Current Status:** No documented policy on licensing requirements for stablecoin issuance

**Gap:** Complete absence of policy addressing regulatory authorization requirements for issuing stablecoins in Reunion or targeting Reunion residents

**Impact:** Potential for regulatory enforcement actions, fines, license revocation, and criminal liability for operating without proper authorization

**Recommendation:** Immediately establish a licensing and authorization policy that: 1) Identifies relevant regulatory bodies in Reunion and France, 2) Documents application requirements, 3) Establishes a compliance review process before any stablecoin issuance

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Stablecoin issuers must maintain adequate reserves (typically 1:1 liquid assets) with regular independent audits (per MiCA and global standards)

**Current Status:** No reserve management or audit policy exists

**Gap:** Missing policies governing reserve composition, custody, segregation, valuation, and independent verification

**Impact:** Risk of insolvency, loss of peg, consumer harm, regulatory sanctions, and loss of market confidence

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive reserve management policy including: 1) 100% reserve requirement with high-quality liquid assets, 2) Segregated custody arrangements, 3) Monthly attestations and quarterly independent audits, 4) Public disclosure of reserve composition

### Gap 3: GAP-003
**Requirement:** AML/CFT compliance including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting (aligned with FATF recommendations and EU AML directives)

**Current Status:** No AML/CFT policy documented

**Gap:** Complete absence of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls for stablecoin transactions

**Impact:** Significant regulatory penalties, potential criminal liability, loss of banking relationships, and reputational damage

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive AML/CFT program including: 1) Risk-based customer identification and verification, 2) Ongoing transaction monitoring, 3) Suspicious activity reporting procedures, 4) Designated compliance officer, 5) Regular employee training

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection measures including clear disclosures, redemption rights, and complaint handling (per MiCA and consumer financial protection regulations)

**Recommendation:** Establish consumer protection framework with: 1) Clear disclosure documents on risks and terms, 2) Guaranteed redemption at par value, 3) Formal complaint handling process, 4) Segregation of consumer funds

### Gap 2: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Operational resilience and cybersecurity requirements for payment systems and financial instruments

**Recommendation:** Develop operational resilience policy covering: 1) Cybersecurity controls and testing, 2) Incident response plan, 3) Business continuity and disaster recovery, 4) Regular security audits and penetration testing

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Governance and risk management framework for financial service providers

**Recommendation:** Establish comprehensive governance framework including: 1) Board-level risk committee, 2) Three lines of defense model, 3) Regular risk assessments, 4) Independent compliance function, 5) Whistleblower protections

### Gap 4: GAP-007
**Requirement:** Data protection and privacy compliance (GDPR for EU territories including Reunion)

**Recommendation:** Implement GDPR compliance program including: 1) Data protection impact assessments, 2) Lawful basis for processing, 3) Data subject rights procedures, 4) Data protection officer appointment, 5) Vendor management for data processors
