# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-29T23:04:49.308792

## Executive Summary
CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY: The company currently operates with no established regulatory compliance framework for digital assets. All major regulatory requirements for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) are completely unaddressed, creating extreme legal, operational, and reputational risks. The absence of AML/CTF, sanctions screening, licensing compliance, and Travel Rule procedures represents critical gaps that could result in immediate regulatory enforcement actions, criminal liability, and business closure. An urgent, comprehensive compliance program development initiative is required before continuing operations in regulated jurisdictions. Priority should be given to establishing basic AML, sanctions, and licensing compliance, followed by consumer protection and market conduct frameworks.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Travel Rule compliance (FATF Recommendation 16) requiring VASPs to collect and share originator/beneficiary information for crypto transactions above threshold amounts

**Current Status:** No policy exists for Travel Rule compliance

**Gap:** Complete absence of procedures for collecting, verifying, or transmitting required customer information for cryptocurrency transactions

**Impact:** Regulatory enforcement actions, fines, license revocation, inability to operate in regulated jurisdictions, potential criminal liability for AML violations

**Recommendation:** Develop and implement a comprehensive Travel Rule compliance program including customer due diligence procedures, information sharing protocols with other VASPs, and transaction monitoring for threshold-based reporting

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) programs as mandated by global regulators (FinCEN, FCA, MAS, etc.)

**Current Status:** No AML/CTF policy framework exists

**Gap:** Missing risk assessment, customer identification program (CIP), ongoing monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and designated compliance officer

**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, loss of banking relationships, reputational damage, potential criminal charges for willful blindness to illicit activity

**Recommendation:** Establish a comprehensive AML/CTF program including: 1) Risk assessment methodology, 2) Customer Identification Program (CIP), 3) Ongoing transaction monitoring, 4) Suspicious Activity Reporting procedures, 5) Designation of AML Compliance Officer

### Gap 3: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Licensing and registration requirements for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) in operational jurisdictions

**Current Status:** No licensing compliance program exists

**Gap:** Absence of procedures for obtaining/maintaining required licenses, regulatory reporting, and ongoing compliance with license conditions

**Impact:** Operating without required licenses, immediate shutdown orders, asset seizures, criminal charges for unlicensed money transmission, inability to access banking services

**Recommendation:** Conduct jurisdictional analysis to identify licensing requirements, establish licensing compliance program, designate regulatory liaison, implement ongoing reporting procedures for each jurisdiction

### Gap 4: GAP-007
**Requirement:** Sanctions compliance (OFAC, EU, UN sanctions screening for cryptocurrency transactions and customers)

**Current Status:** No sanctions screening procedures exist

**Gap:** Missing screening of customers, transactions, or wallet addresses against sanctions lists, no blocked property reporting procedures

**Impact:** Severe civil and criminal penalties for sanctions violations, loss of correspondent banking relationships, designation as blocked entity, potential criminal prosecution

**Recommendation:** Implement automated sanctions screening for: 1) Customer onboarding, 2) Transaction monitoring, 3) Wallet address screening, 4) Regular updates to sanctions lists, 5) Blocked property reporting procedures

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Market Abuse Regulation compliance (prohibition of insider trading, market manipulation, and unlawful disclosure in crypto markets)

**Recommendation:** Develop market conduct policies including: 1) Insider trading prohibitions, 2) Market manipulation detection and prevention, 3) Employee trading restrictions, 4) Information barriers between business units

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements (clear terms of service, risk disclosures, fee transparency, complaint handling)

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive consumer protection framework including: 1) Clear risk disclosures for crypto investments, 2) Transparent fee schedules, 3) Standardized terms of service, 4) Formal complaint resolution process, 5) Customer asset safeguarding policies

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Data privacy and security requirements (GDPR, CCPA, and other data protection regulations for handling customer information)

**Recommendation:** Develop and implement: 1) Comprehensive data privacy policy compliant with applicable regulations, 2) Cybersecurity framework with multi-signature wallets, cold storage procedures, and access controls, 3) Incident response and breach notification plan, 4) Data retention and destruction policy
