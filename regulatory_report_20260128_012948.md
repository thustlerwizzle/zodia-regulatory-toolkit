# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-28T01:23:52.825811

## Executive Summary
The company has established comprehensive policy frameworks for core compliance areas but shows significant gaps in jurisdiction-specific registration and licensing requirements. Critical gaps exist in sanctions screening and Travel Rule implementation. High priority gaps in UK, South Africa, and UAE licensing must be addressed immediately to avoid legal exposure. The policies demonstrate good foundational work but require specific operational procedures for each jurisdiction's unique requirements. Overall compliance status is partial, with strong frameworks but insufficient jurisdictional specificity.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-REG-008
**Requirement:** Real-time sanctions screening - OFAC, EU, UK, UAE sanctions lists screening for digital asset transactions

**Current Status:** Policy GAP-008 covers transaction monitoring but lacks specific procedures for real-time sanctions screening against multiple jurisdictional lists

**Gap:** No documented procedures for real-time screening of digital asset transactions against OFAC, EU, UK, UAE, and UN sanctions lists, including wallet address screening

**Impact:** Violating sanctions regulations could result in severe penalties, including criminal prosecution, massive fines, and loss of banking relationships

**Recommendation:** Create Sanctions Screening Policy detailing: 1) Real-time screening procedures for digital asset transactions, 2) Multi-jurisdictional list management, 3) Wallet address screening protocols, 4) Match investigation and reporting procedures

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-REG-001
**Requirement:** South Africa FIC Act - Mandatory registration as an accountable institution with the Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) and submission of Risk Management and Compliance Programme (RMCP)

**Recommendation:** Create South Africa-specific annex to Policy GAP-006 detailing: 1) FIC registration process, 2) RMCP development and submission requirements, 3) Specific reporting obligations (CTRs, STRs), 4) FIC directive implementation procedures

### Gap 2: GAP-REG-002
**Requirement:** UAE Federal AML Regulations (outside VARA) - Mandatory registration with Central Bank UAE or relevant supervisory authority for financial institutions

**Recommendation:** Add UAE Federal licensing annex to Policy GAP-006 detailing: 1) License determination matrix (which authority regulates which activities), 2) Application procedures for each relevant authority, 3) Ongoing reporting requirements specific to UAE federal regulators

### Gap 3: GAP-REG-004
**Requirement:** FATF Travel Rule (Recommendation 16) - Mandatory collection and transmission of originator/beneficiary information for VASP-to-VASP transfers

**Recommendation:** Create Travel Rule Implementation Policy detailing: 1) Jurisdictional applicability matrix, 2) Data collection procedures, 3) Secure transmission protocols, 4) Record-keeping requirements, 5) Exception handling procedures

### Gap 4: GAP-REG-006
**Requirement:** UK MLR 2017 - Specific requirements for cryptoasset businesses including FCA registration and ongoing supervision

**Recommendation:** Add UK-specific annex to Policy GAP-006 detailing: 1) FCA cryptoasset registration process, 2) UK-specific ML/TF risk assessment, 3) FCA reporting requirements, 4) Senior Managers Regime applicability
