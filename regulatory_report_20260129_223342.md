# Gap Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-01-29T22:26:37.639375

## Executive Summary
The company exhibits a complete absence of documented compliance policies and frameworks across all critical regulatory domains for digital asset businesses. This represents an extreme compliance risk that could result in immediate regulatory enforcement actions, substantial fines, license denials, criminal liability for executives, and potential business closure. The organization lacks even basic compliance infrastructure and appears to be operating without regard to fundamental regulatory requirements. Immediate and comprehensive remediation is required, beginning with critical priority gaps (AML/CTF, sanctions, cybersecurity, and licensing) before addressing high and medium priority areas. The company should consider engaging external compliance consultants and legal counsel to develop and implement a complete regulatory compliance program within an aggressive timeline.

## Critical Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-001
**Requirement:** Travel Rule compliance (FATF Recommendation 16) - VASP-to-VASP transfers of digital assets require originator and beneficiary information sharing for transactions above threshold amounts (typically $/€1,000)

**Current Status:** No policy exists for Travel Rule compliance

**Gap:** Complete absence of Travel Rule framework, including customer due diligence, information collection, secure transmission protocols, and record-keeping requirements

**Impact:** Regulatory enforcement actions, fines, license revocation, inability to transact with other regulated VASPs, potential criminal liability for AML violations

**Recommendation:** Implement Travel Rule compliance program including: 1) Customer identification and verification procedures, 2) Transaction monitoring for threshold triggers, 3) Secure information sharing protocol with other VASPs, 4) Record retention system, 5) Staff training

### Gap 2: GAP-002
**Requirement:** Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) programs as required by global regulators (FinCEN, FCA, MAS, etc.)

**Current Status:** No AML/CTF program documented

**Gap:** Missing comprehensive AML/CTF framework including risk assessment, customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and designated compliance officer

**Impact:** Severe regulatory penalties, criminal prosecution, loss of banking relationships, reputational damage, potential business closure

**Recommendation:** Develop and implement a risk-based AML/CTF program with: 1) Designated AML Compliance Officer, 2) Customer Risk Assessment methodology, 3) Enhanced Due Diligence for high-risk customers, 4) Transaction monitoring system, 5) SAR filing procedures, 6) Independent testing

### Gap 3: GAP-005
**Requirement:** Cybersecurity and operational resilience requirements (NYDFS Part 500, EU DORA, various global standards)

**Current Status:** No cybersecurity framework documented

**Gap:** Missing cybersecurity program, incident response plan, third-party risk management, penetration testing, and data protection controls

**Impact:** Data breaches, theft of customer assets, regulatory sanctions, operational disruption, loss of customer confidence, potential business failure

**Recommendation:** Implement cybersecurity framework: 1) Comprehensive information security policy, 2) Multi-signature and cold storage for assets, 3) Incident response and business continuity plans, 4) Regular penetration testing and audits, 5) Employee security training, 6) Third-party vendor risk assessment

### Gap 4: GAP-006
**Requirement:** Licensing and registration requirements for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs)

**Current Status:** No documented licensing strategy or compliance

**Gap:** Unclear regulatory status, missing license applications, no jurisdictional analysis, and absence of regulatory relationship management

**Impact:** Operating without required licenses, immediate cease-and-desist orders, asset seizures, criminal prosecution of executives, inability to operate legally

**Recommendation:** Conduct jurisdictional analysis and implement licensing strategy: 1) Map operations against global regulatory requirements, 2) Prioritize key market licenses, 3) Establish regulatory engagement plan, 4) Document license applications and maintenance procedures, 5) Appoint regulatory liaison officer

### Gap 5: GAP-008
**Requirement:** Sanctions compliance (OFAC, EU sanctions regimes, global sanctions lists)

**Current Status:** No sanctions screening program documented

**Gap:** Missing real-time sanctions screening, blocked persons list checking, geographic risk assessment, and blocked asset procedures

**Impact:** Severe civil and criminal penalties, loss of banking access, inclusion on sanctions lists, potential imprisonment for executives

**Recommendation:** Implement sanctions compliance program: 1) Real-time screening of customers and transactions against sanctions lists, 2) Geographic risk assessment, 3) Procedures for blocking and reporting sanctioned transactions, 4) Regular OFAC compliance training, 5) Independent testing of sanctions controls

## High Priority Gaps

### Gap 1: GAP-003
**Requirement:** Market Abuse Regulation compliance (EU MAR, US SEC rules) - preventing insider trading, market manipulation, and unlawful disclosure of inside information

**Recommendation:** Establish market conduct framework: 1) Insider information policy and controls, 2) Employee trading restrictions and pre-clearance procedures, 3) Market surveillance system for manipulation detection, 4) Training on market abuse risks, 5) Whistleblower protection program

### Gap 2: GAP-004
**Requirement:** Consumer protection and disclosure requirements (MiCA in EU, various state regulations in US)

**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive consumer protection program: 1) Clear, fair, and not misleading disclosure documents, 2) Prominent risk warnings for digital assets, 3) Transparent fee schedule, 4) Formal complaint handling process, 5) Dispute resolution mechanism

### Gap 3: GAP-007
**Requirement:** Tax compliance and reporting (FATCA, CRS, IRS Form 1099, various global tax regulations)

**Recommendation:** Establish tax compliance program: 1) Customer tax information collection (W-9, W-8BEN, etc.), 2) Transaction reporting procedures, 3) Withholding mechanisms where required, 4) Regulatory filing calendar and processes, 5) Customer tax statement generation
